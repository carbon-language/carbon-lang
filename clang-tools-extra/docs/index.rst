Doxygen Documentation
=====================
This documentation describes the **internal** software that makes up the
tools of clang-tools-extra, not the **external** use of these tools. There
are no instructions here on how to use the tools, only the APIs that make
up the software. For usage instructions, please see the user's guide or
reference manual for each tool.

.. _`Doxygen documentation`: doxygen/index.html

..  note::
    This documentation is generated directly from the source code with doxygen.
    Since the tools of clang-tools-extra are constantly under active development,
    what you're about to read is out of date!
