cppcoreguidelines-pro-type-static-cast-downcast
===============================================

This check flags all usages of static_cast, where a base class is casted to a derived class.
In those cases, a fixit is provided to convert the cast to a dynamic_cast.

Use of these casts can violate type safety and cause the program to access a variable that is actually of type X to be accessed as if it were of an unrelated type Z.

This rule is part of the "Type safety" profile of the C++ Core Guidelines, see
https://github.com/isocpp/CppCoreGuidelines/blob/master/CppCoreGuidelines.md#-type2-dont-use-static_cast-downcasts-use-dynamic_cast-instead
