android-cloexec-pipe
====================

This check detects usage of ``pipe()``. Using ``pipe()`` is not recommended, ``pipe2()`` is the
suggested replacement. The check also adds the O_CLOEXEC flag that marks the file descriptor to
be closed in child processes. Without this flag a sensitive file descriptor can be leaked to a
child process, potentially into a lower-privileged SELinux domain.

Examples:

.. code-block:: c++

  pipe(pipefd);

Suggested replacement:

.. code-block:: c++

  pipe2(pipefd, O_CLOEXEC);
