// Various clangd features have configurable behaviour (or can be disabled).
// The configuration system allows users to control this:
//  - in a user config file, a project config file, via LSP, or via flags
//  - specifying different settings for different files
//
// This file defines the config::Fragment structure which models one piece of
// configuration as obtained from a source like a file.
//
// This is distinct from how the config is interpreted (CompiledFragment),
// combined (Provider) and exposed to the rest of clangd (Config).
//
//===----------------------------------------------------------------------===//
//
// To add a new configuration option, you must:
//  - add its syntactic form to Fragment
//  - update ConfigYAML.cpp to parse it
//  - add its semantic form to Config (in Config.h)
//  - update ConfigCompile.cpp to map Fragment -> Config
//  - make use of the option inside clangd
//  - document the new option (config.md in the llvm/clangd-www repository)
