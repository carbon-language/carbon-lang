// Tweaks are small actions that run over the AST and produce edits, messages
// etc as a result. They are local, i.e. they should take the current editor
// context, e.g. the cursor position and selection into account.
// The actions are executed in two stages:
//   - Stage 1 should check whether the action is available in a current
//     context. It should be cheap and fast to compute as it is executed for all
//     available actions on every client request, which happen quite frequently.
//   - Stage 2 is performed after stage 1 and can be more expensive to compute.
//     It is performed when the user actually chooses the action.
