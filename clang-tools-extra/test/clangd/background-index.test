# We need to splice paths into file:// URIs for this test.
# UNSUPPORTED: win32

# Use a copy of inputs, as we'll mutate it (as will the background index).
# RUN: rm -rf %t
# RUN: cp -r %S/Inputs/background-index %t
# Need to embed the correct temp path in the actual JSON-RPC requests.
# RUN: sed -i -e "s|DIRECTORY|%t|" %t/*

# We're editing bar.cpp, which includes foo.h.
# foo() is declared in foo.h and defined in foo.cpp.
# The background index should allow us to go-to-definition on foo().
# RUN: clangd -background-index -lit-test < %t/definition.jsonrpc | FileCheck %t/definition.jsonrpc

# Test that the index is writing files in the expected location.
# RUN: ls %t/.clangd-index/foo.cpp.*.idx

# Test the index is read from disk: delete code and restart clangd.
# FIXME: This test currently fails as we don't read the index yet.
# RUN: rm %t/foo.cpp
# RUN: clangd -background-index -lit-test < %t/definition.jsonrpc | not FileCheck %t/definition.jsonrpc
