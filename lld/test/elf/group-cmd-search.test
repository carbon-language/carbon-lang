  XFAIL: win32

  This test does not pass on Windows because a path starting with
  "/" is not considered as an absolute path. (It needs a drive
  letter.)

/*
  In general the linker scripts's GROUP command works like a pair
  of command line options --start-group/--end-group. But there is
  a difference in the files look up algorithm.

  The --start-group/--end-group commands use a trivial approach:
  a) If the path has '-l' prefix, add 'lib' prefix and '.a'/'.so'
     suffix and search the path through library search directories.
  b) Otherwise, use the path 'as-is'.

  The GROUP command implements more compicated approach:
  a) If the path has '-l' prefix, add 'lib' prefix and '.a'/'.so'
     suffix and search the path through library search directories.
  b) If the path does not have '-l' prefix, and sysroot is configured,
     and the path starts with the / character, and the script being
     processed is located inside the sysroot, search the path under
     the sysroot. Otherwise, try to open the path in the current
     directory. If it is not found, search through library search
     directories.
