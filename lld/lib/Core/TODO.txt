* Add endianness support to the native reader and writer.

* The NativeReader has lots of similar code for converting arrays of ivar
  data in mapped memory into arrays of objects.  The commonality can be
  factored out, maybe templatized.

* The NativeFileFormat.h is old school C structs and constants.  We scope
  things better by defining constants used with a struct inside the struct
  declaration.

* The native reader and writer currently just blast in memory enumeration
  values (e.g. DefinedAtom::Scope) into a byte in the disk format.  To support
  future changes to the enumerations, there should be a translation layer
  to map disk values to in-memory values.

* The Platform interface needs to be refactored.  There should be less work
  done in the platform.  Instead the Platform should just be a bunch of bool
  methods which direct the Resolver in how to operate.  Subclasses of
  Platform can set the bool values in their constructors.

* The YamlReader should be converted to use Michael's yaml parser once
  that goes into LLVM.
