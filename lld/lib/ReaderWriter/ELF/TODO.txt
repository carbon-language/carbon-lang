~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Implement processing of DT_NEEDED elements including -rpath-link /
  -rpath processing.

- Create DT_SONAME.

- _GLOBAL_OFFSET_TABLE should be hidden and normally dropped from the output.

- Find out where __tls_get_addr gets created and stop that.

- Preserve SHT_NOTE sections from input, merge them if applicable.

- Do not create __got_* / __plt_* symbol table entries by default.

- Weak references to symbols defined in a DSO should remain weak.
