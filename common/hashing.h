// This **not** a cryptographically secure or stable hash -- it is only designed
// for use with in-memory hash table style data structures. Being fast and
// effective for that use case is the guiding principle of its design.
//
// There is no guarantee that the values produced are stable from execution to
// execution. For speed and quality reasons, the implementation does not
// introduce any variance to defend against accidental dependencies. As a
// consequence, it is strongly encouraged to use a seed that varies from
// execution to execution to avoid depending on specific values produced.
//
// The algorithm used is most heavily based on [Abseil's hashing algorithm][1],
// with some additional ideas and inspiration from the fallback hashing
// algorithm in [Rust's AHash][2] and the [FxHash][3] function. However, there
// are also *significant* changes introduced here.
//
// [1]: https://github.com/abseil/abseil-cpp/tree/master/absl/hash/internal
// [2]: https://github.com/tkaitchuck/aHash/wiki/AHash-fallback-algorithm
// [3]: https://docs.rs/fxhash/latest/fxhash/
//
// This hash algorithm does *not* defend against hash flooding. While it can be
// viewed as "keyed" on the seed, it is expected to be possible to craft inputs
// for some data types that cancel out the seed used and manufacture endlessly
// colliding sets of keys. In general, this function works to be *fast* for hash
// tables. If you need to defend against hash flooding, either directly use a
// data structure with strong worst-case guarantees, or a hash table which
// detects catastrophic collisions and falls back to such a data structure.
//
// This hash function is heavily optimized for *latency* over *quality*. Modern
// hash tables designs can efficiently handle reasonable collision rates,
// including using extra bits from the hash to avoid all efficiency coming from
// the same low bits. Because of this, low-latency is significantly more
// important for performance than high-quality, and this is heavily leveraged.
// The result is that the hash codes produced *do* have significant avalanche
// problems for small keys. The upside is that the latency for hashing integers,
// pointers, and small byte strings (up to 32-bytes) is exceptionally low, and
// essentially a small constant time instruction sequence.
//
// No exotic instruction set extensions are required, and the state used is
// small. It does rely on being able to get the low- and high-64-bit results of
// a 64-bit multiply efficiently.
//
// The function supports many typical data types such as primitives, string-ish
// views, and types composing primitives transparently like pairs, tuples, and
// array-ish views. It is also extensible to support user-defined types.
//
// The builtin support for string-like types include:
// - `std::string_view`
// - `std::string`
// - `llvm::StringRef`
// - `llvm::SmallString`
//
// This function supports heterogeneous lookup between all of the string-like
// types. It also supports heterogeneous lookup between pointer types regardless
// of pointee type and `nullptr`.
//
// However, these are the only heterogeneous lookup support including for the
// builtin in, standard, and LLVM types. Notably, each different size and
// signedness integer type may hash differently for efficiency reasons. Hash
// tables should pick a single integer type in which to manage keys and do
// lookups.
//
// To add support for your type, you need to implement a customization point --
// a free function that can be found by ADL for your type -- called
// `CarbonHashValue` with the following signature:
//
// ```cpp
// auto CarbonHashValue(const YourType& value, uint64_t seed) -> HashCode;
// ```
//
// The extension point needs to ensure that values that compare equal (including
// any comparisons with different types that might be used with a hash table of
// `YourType` keys) produce the same `HashCode` values.
//
// `HashCode` values should typically be produced using the `Hasher` helper type
// below. See its documentation for more details about implementing these
// customization points and how best to incorporate the value's state into a
// `HashCode`.
//
// For two input values that are almost but not quite equal, the extension
// point should maximize the probability of each bit of their resulting
// `HashCode`s differing. More formally, `HashCode`s should exhibit an
// [avalanche effect][4]. However, while this is desirable, it should be
// **secondary** to low latency. The intended use case of these functions is not
// cryptography but in-memory hashtables where the latency and overhead of
// computing the `HashCode` is *significantly* more important than achieving a
// particularly high quality. The goal is to have "just enough" avalanche
// effect, but there is not a fixed criteria for how much is enough. That should
// be determined through practical experimentation with a hashtable and
// distribution of keys.
