// A namespace collecting a set of low-level utilities for building hashtable
// data structures. These should only be used as implementation details of
// higher-level data-structure APIs.
//
// The utilities here use the `hashtable_key_context.h` provided `KeyContext` to
// support the necessary hashtable operations on keys: hashing and comparison.
// This also serves as the customization point for hashtables built on this
// infrastructure for those operations. See that header file for details.
//
// These utilities support hashtables following a *specific* API design pattern,
// and using Small-Size Optimization, or "SSO", when desired. We expect there to
// be three layers to any hashtable design:
//
// - A *view* type: a read-only view of the hashtable contents. This type should
//   be a value type and is expected to be passed by-value in APIs. However, it
//   will have `const`-reference semantics, much like a `std::string_view`. Note
//   that the *entries* will continue to be mutable, it is only the *table* that
//   is read-only.
//
// - A *base* type: a base class type of the actual hashtable, which allows
//   almost all mutable operations but erases any specific SSO buffer size.
//   Because this is a base of the actual hash table, it is designed to be
//   passed as a non-`const` reference or pointer.
//
// - A *table* type: the actual hashtable which derives from the base type and
//   adds any desired SSO storage buffer. Beyond the physical storage, it also
//   allows resetting the table to its initial state & allocated size, as well
//   as copying and moving the table.
//
// For complete examples of the API design, see `set.h` for a hashtable-based
// set data structure, and `map.h` for a hashtable-based map data structure.
//
// The hashtable design implemented here has several key invariants and design
// elements that are essential to all three of the types above and the
// functionality they provide.
//
// - The underlying hashtable uses [open addressing], a power-of-two table size,
//   and quadratic probing rather than closed addressing and chaining.
//
//   [open addressing]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_addressing
//
// - Each _slot_ in the table corresponds to a key, a value, and one byte of
//   metadata. Each _entry_ is a key and value. The key and value for an entry
//   are stored together.
//
// - The allocated storage is organized into an array of metadata bytes followed
//   by an array of entry storage.
//
// - The metadata byte corresponding to each entry marks that entry is either
//   empty, deleted, or present. When present, a 7-bit tag is also stored using
//   another 7 bits from the hash of the entry key.
//
// - The storage for an entry is an internal type that should not be exposed to
//   users, and instead only the underlying keys and values.
//
// - The hash addressing and probing occurs over *groups* of slots rather than
//   individual entries. When inserting a new entry, it can be added to the
//   group it hashes to as long it is not full, and can even replace a slot with
//   a tombstone indicating a previously deleted entry. Only when the group is
//   full will it look at the next group in the probe sequence. As a result,
//   there may be entries in a group where a different group is the start of
//   that entry's probe sequence. Also, when performing a lookup, every group in
//   the probe sequence must be inspected for the lookup key until it is found
//   or the group has an empty slot.
//
// - Groups are scanned rapidly using the one-byte metadata for each entry in
//   the group and CPU instructions that allow comparing all of the metadata for
//   a group in parallel. For more details on the metadata group encoding and
//   scanning, see `raw_hashtable_metadata_group.h`.
//
// - `GroupSize` is a platform-specific relatively small power of two that fits
//   in some hardware register. However, `MaxGroupSize` is provided as a
//   portable max that is also a power of two. The table storage, whether
//   provided by an SSO buffer or allocated, is required to be a multiple of
//   `MaxGroupSize` to keep the requirement portable but sufficient for all
//   platforms.
//
// - There is *always* an allocated table of some multiple of `MaxGroupSize`.
//   This allows accesses to be branchless. When heap allocated, we pro-actively
//   allocate at least a minimum heap size table. When there is a small-size
//   optimization (SSO) buffer, that provides the initial allocation.
//
// - The table performs a minimal amount of bookkeeping that limits the APIs it
//   can support:
//    - `alloc_size` is the size of the table *allocated* (not *used*), and is
//       always a power of 2 at least as big as `MinAllocatedSize`.
//    - `storage` is a pointer to the storage for the `alloc_size` slots of the
//       table, and never null.
//    - `small_alloc_size` is the maximum `alloc_size` where the table is stored
//       in the object itself instead of separately on the heap. In this case,
//       `storage` points to `small_storage_`.
//    - `growth_budget` is the number of entries that may be added before the
//       table allocation is doubled. It is always
//       `GrowthThresholdForAllocSize(alloc_size)` minus the number of
//       non-empty (filled or deleted) slots. If it ever falls to 0, the table
//       is grown to keep it greater than 0.
//   There is also the "moved-from" state where the table may only be
//   reinitialized or destroyed where the `alloc_size` is 0 and `storage` is
//   null. Since it doesn't track the exact number of filled entries in a table,
//   it doesn't support a container-style `size` API.
//
// - There is no direct iterator support because of the complexity of embedding
//   the group-based metadata scanning into an iterator model. Instead, there is
//   just a for-each method that is passed a lambda to observe all entries. The
//   order of this observation is also not guaranteed.

// A particularly common and important-to-optimize path is growing to the next

// allows an important optimization -- we're adding exactly one more high bit to
// the hash-computed index for each entry. This in turn means we can classify
// every entry in the table into three cases:
//
// 1) The new high bit is zero, the entry is at the same index in the new
//    table as the old.
//
// 2) The new high bit is one, the entry is at the old index plus the old
//    size.
//
// 3) The entry's current index doesn't match the initial hash index because
//    it required some amount of probing to find an empty slot.
//
// The design of the hash table tries to minimize how many entries fall into
// case (3), so we expect the vast majority of entries to be in (1) or (2). This
// lets us model growth notionally as copying the hashtable twice into the lower
// and higher halves of the new allocation, clearing out the now-empty slots
// (from both deleted entries and entries in the other half of the table after
// growth), and inserting any probed elements. That model in turn is much more
// efficient than re-inserting all of the elements as it avoids the unnecessary
// parts of insertion and avoids interleaving random accesses for the probed
// elements. But most importantly, for trivially relocatable types it allows us
