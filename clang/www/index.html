  <h1>clang: a C language family frontend for LLVM</h1>
  <!--*********************************************************************-->
  
  <p>The goal of the Clang project is to create a new C, C++, Objective C and
  Objective C++ front-end for the <a href="http://www.llvm.org/">LLVM</a>
  compiler.</p>
  
  <!--=====================================================================-->
  <h2><a name="goals">Features and Goals</a></h2>
  <!--=====================================================================-->
  
  <p>Some of the goals for the project include the following:</p>
  
  <p><b><a href="features.html#enduser">End-User Features</a></b>:</p>

  <ul>
  <li>High performance and low memory use</li>
  <li>Expressive diagnostics</li>
  <li>GCC compatibility</li>
  </ul>

  <p><b><a href="features.html#applications">Utility and 
     Applications</a></b>:</p>

  <ul>
  <li>Library based architecture</li>
  <li>Support diverse clients</li>
  <li>Integration with IDEs</li>
  <li>Use the LLVM 'BSD' License</li>
  </ul>

  <p><b><a href="features.html#design">Internal Design and 
     Implementation</a></b>:</p>

  <ul>
  <li>A real-world, production quality compiler</li>
  <li>A simple and hackable code base</li>
  <li>A single unified parser for C, Objective C, C++, and Objective C++</li>
  <li>Conformance with C/C++/ObjC and their variants</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Of course this is only a rough outline of the goals and features of
     Clang.  To get a true sense of what it is all about, see the <a 
     href="features.html">Features</a> section, which breaks
     each of these down and explains them in more detail.</p>

     
  <!--=====================================================================-->
  <h2>Why?</h2>
  <!--=====================================================================-->
  
  <p>The development of a new front-end was started out of a need -- a need
     for a compiler that allows better diagnostics, better integration with
     IDEs, a license that is compatible with commercial products, and a
     nimble compiler that is easy to develop and maintain.  All of these were
     motivations for starting work on a new front-end that could
     meet these needs.</p>
     
  <p>A good (but quite dated) introduction to Clang can be found in the
     following video lectures:</p>
     
  <ul>
    <li><a href="clang_video-05-25-2007.html">Clang Introduction</a>
        (May 2007)</li>
    <li><a href="clang_video-07-25-2007.html">Features and Performance of 
        Clang</a>  (July 2007)</li>
  </ul>

     see the <a href="comparison.html">clang comparison page</a>.</p>
  
  <!--=====================================================================-->
  <h2>Current Status</h2>
  <!--=====================================================================-->
  
  <p>Clang is still in early development stages.  If you are looking for
  source analysis or source-to-source transformation tools, clang is probably
  a great solution for you.  If you want to use it as a drop in C compiler, it
  is not yet ready.</p>

  <p>Clang currently has pretty good parsing and semantic analysis support for
     C and Objective-C right now, and bugs are usually quickly fixed once
     reported.  C++ support is still very early, and we don't expect to have
     respectable C++ support for another 2 years or so.</p>
