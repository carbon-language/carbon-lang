<title>Minimal clang home page</title>

<p>
This is a bare bones web page for the "clang" C front-end.  This project is to
build a new C/C++/ObjC front-end for <a href="http://llvm.org">LLVM</a>.
</p>

<p>The motivation for this project is described well in Steve Naroff's talk
at the <a href="http://llvm.org/devmtg/2007-05/">2007 LLVM Developer Meeting</a>.
A <a href="http://llvm.org/devmtg/2007-05/09-Naroff-CFE.mov">video</a> and 
<a href="http://llvm.org/devmtg/2007-05/09-Naroff-CFE.pdf">slides</a> are 
available.</p>

<p>To get and build the source, please follow <a 
href="http://lists.cs.uiuc.edu/pipermail/llvmdev/2007-July/009817.html">these 
directions</a>.</p>

<p>If you are interested in discussing this work, please join the <a 
href="http://lists.cs.uiuc.edu/mailman/listinfo/cfe-dev">cfe-dev</a> mailing 
list.  If you are interested in contributing to it or following its progress,
please join the <a href="http://lists.cs.uiuc.edu/mailman/listinfo/cfe-commits">

<p>Please note that we don't consider this to be ready for people to take and
compile random pieces of code with yet.  However, if you'd like to do so 
<em>and</em> help fix problems exposed by doing so, we'd appreciate the help.</p>
