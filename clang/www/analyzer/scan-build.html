<h1>Running the Analyzer</h1>

<p>While the static analyzer engine can be used as a library, many users will
likely use the command-line interface to the analyzer to analyze projects. This
page documents <tt>scan-build</tt>, a program that users can use from the
command line to analyze all the source files used to build a project.</p>

<h2 id="scanbuild">scan-build</h2>

<p>The <tt>scan-build</tt> command can be used to analyze an entire project by
essentially interposing on a project's build process. This means that to run the
analyzer using <tt>scan-build</tt>, you will use <tt>scan-build</tt> to analyze
the source files compiled by <tt>gcc</tt> during a project build. This means
that any files that are not compiled will also not be analyzed.</p>

<h3 id="scanbuild_basicusage">Basic Usage</h3>

<p>Basic usage of <tt>scan-build</tt> is designed to be simple: just place the
word &quot;scan-build&quot; in front of your build command:</p>

<pre class="code_example">
$ <span class="code_highlight">scan-build</span> make
$ <span class="code_highlight">scan-build</span> xcodebuild
</pre>

<p>In the first case <tt>scan-build</tt> analyzes the code of a project built
with <tt>make</tt> and in the second case <tt>scan-build</tt> analyzes a project
built using <tt>xcodebuild</tt>.<p>
  
<p>Here is the general format for invoking <tt>scan-build</tt>:</p>

<pre class="code_example">
$ <span class="code_highlight">scan-build</span> <i>[scan-build options]</i> <span class="code_highlight">&lt;command&gt;</span> <i>[command options]</i>
</pre>

<p>Operationally, <tt>scan-build</tt> literally runs <command> with all of the
subsequent options passed to it. For example, one can pass <nobr><tt>-j4</tt></nobr> to
<tt>make</tt> get a parallel build over 4 cores:</p>

<pre class="code_example">
$ scan-build make <span class="code_highlight">-j4</span>
</pre>

<p>In almost all cases, <tt>scan-build</tt> makes no effort to interpret the
options after the build command; it simply passes them through. In general,
<tt>scan-build</tt> should support parallel builds, but <b>not distributed
builds</b>.</p>

<p>It is also possible to use <tt>scan-build</tt> to analyze specific
files:</p>

<pre class="code_example">
 $ scan-build gcc -c <span class="code_highlight">t1.c t2.c</span>
</pre>

<p>This example causes the files <tt>t1.c</tt> and <tt>t2.c</tt> to be analyzed.
</p>

<h3 id="scanbuild_otheroptions">Other Options</h3>

<p>As mentioned above, extra options can be passed to <tt>scan-build</tt>. These
options prefix the build command. For example:</p>

<pre class="code_example">
 $ scan-build <span class="code_highlight">-k -V</span> make
 $ scan-build <span class="code_highlight">-k -V</span> xcodebuild
</pre>

<p>Here is a subset of useful options:</p>

<table>
<thead><tr><td>Option</td><td>Description</td></tr></thead>

<tr><td><b>-o</b></td><td>Target directory for HTML report files. Subdirectories
will be created as needed to represent separate "runs" of the analyzer. If this
option is not specified, a directory is created in <tt>/tmp</tt> to store the
reports.</td><tr>

<tr><td><b>-h</b><br><i><nobr>(or no arguments)</nobr></i></td><td>Display all
<tt>scan-build</tt> options.</td></tr>

<tr><td><b>-k</b><br><nobr><b>--keep-going</b></nobr></td><td>Add a "keep on
going" option to the specified build command. <p>This option currently supports
<tt>make</tt> and <tt>xcodebuild</tt>.</p> <p>This is a convenience option; one
can specify this behavior directly using build options.</p></td></tr>

<tr><td><b>-v<b></td><td>Verbose output from scan-build and the analyzer. <b>A
second and third "-v" increases verbosity</b>, and is useful for filing bug
reports against the analyzer.</td></tr>

<tr><td><b>-V</b></td><td>View analysis results in a web browser when the build
command completes.</td></tr> </table>

<p>A complete list of options can be obtained by running <tt>scan-build</tt>
with no arguments.</p>

<h3 id="scanbuild_output">Output of scan-build</h3>

<p>
The output of scan-build is a set of HTML files, each one which represents a
separate bug report. A single <tt>index.html</tt> file is generated for
surveying all of the bugs. You can then just open <tt>index.html</tt> in a web
browser to view the bug reports.
</p>

<p>
Where the HTML files are generated is specified with a <b>-o</b> option to
<tt>scan-build</tt>. If <b>-o</b> isn't specified, a directory in <tt>/tmp</tt>
is created to store the files (<tt>scan-build</tt> will print a message telling
you where they are). If you want to view the reports immediately after the build
completes, pass <b>-V</b> to <tt>scan-build</tt>.
</p>


<h2 id="recommendedguidelines">Recommended Usage Guidelines</h2>

<p>This section describes a few recommendations with running the analyzer.</p>

<h3 id="recommended_debug">Always Analyze a Project in its &quot;Debug&quot; Configuration</h3>

<p>Most projects can be built in a &quot;debug&quot; mode that enables assertions.
Assertions are picked up by the static analyzer to prune infeasible paths, which
in some cases can greatly reduce the number of false positives (bogus error
reports) emitted by the tool.</p>

<h3 id="recommend_verbose">Use Verbose Output when Debugging scan-build</h3>

<p><tt>scan-build</tt> takes a <b>-v</b> option to emit verbose output about
what it's doing; two <b>-v</b> options emit more information. Redirecting the
output of <tt>scan-build</tt> to a text file (make sure to redirect standard
error) is useful for filing bug reports against <tt>scan-build</tt> or the
analyzer, as we can see the exact options (and files) passed to the analyzer.
For more comprehensible logs, don't perform a parallel build.</p>

<h3 id="recommended_autoconf">Run './configure' through scan-build</h3>

<p>If an analyzed project uses an autoconf generated <tt>configure</tt> script,
you will probably need to run <tt>configure</tt> script through
<tt>scan-build</tt> in order to analyze the project.</p>

<p><b>Example</b></p>

<pre class="code_example">
$ scan-build ./configure
$ scan-build make
</pre>

<p>The reason <tt>configure</tt> also needs to be run through
<tt>scan-build</tt> is because <tt>scan-build</tt> scans your source files by
<i>interposing</i> on the compiler. This interposition is currently done by
<tt>scan-build</tt> temporarily setting the environment variable <tt>CC</tt> to
<tt>ccc-analyzer</tt>. The program <tt>ccc-analyzer</tt> acts like a fake
compiler, forwarding its command line arguments over to <tt>gcc</tt> to perform
regular compilation and <tt>clang</tt> to perform static analysis.</p>

<p>Running <tt>configure</tt> typically generates makefiles that have hardwired
paths to the compiler, and by running <tt>configure</tt> through
<tt>scan-build</tt> that path is set to <tt>ccc-analyzer</tt>.</p.>

<!-- 
<h2 id="Debugging">Debugging the Analyzer</h2>

<p>This section provides information on debugging the analyzer, and troubleshooting
it when you have problems analyzing a particular project.</p>

<h3>How it Works</h3>

<p>To analyze a project, <tt>scan-build</tt> simply sets the environment variable
<tt>CC</tt> to the full path to <tt>ccc-analyzer</tt>. It also sets a few other
environment variables to communicate to <tt>ccc-analyzer</tt> where to dump HTML
report files.</p>

<p>Some Makefiles (or equivalent project files) hardcode the compiler; for such
projects simply overriding <tt>CC</tt> won't cause <tt>ccc-analyzer</tt> to be
called. This will cause the compiled code <b>to not be analyzed.</b></p> If you
find that your code isn't being analyzed, check to see if <tt>CC</tt> is
hardcoded. If this is the case, you can hardcode it instead to the <b>full
path</b> to <tt>ccc-analyzer</tt>.</p>

<p>When applicable, you can also run <tt>./configure</tt> for a project through
<tt>scan-build</tt> so that configure sets up the location of <tt>CC</tt> based
on the environment passed in from <tt>scan-build</tt>:

<pre>
  $ scan-build <b>./configure</b>
</pre>

<p><tt>scan-build</tt> has special knowledge about <tt>configure</tt>, so it in
most cases will not actually analyze the configure tests run by
<tt>configure</tt>.</p>

<p>Under the hood, <tt>ccc-analyzer</tt> directly invokes <tt>gcc</tt> to
compile the actual code in addition to running the analyzer (which occurs by it
calling <tt>clang</tt>). <tt>ccc-analyzer</tt> tries to correctly forward all
the arguments over to <tt>gcc</tt>, but this may not work perfectly (please
report bugs of this kind).
