/// \brief A semantic tree transformation that allows one to transform one
/// abstract syntax tree into another.
///
/// A new tree transformation is defined by creating a new subclass \c X of
/// \c TreeTransform<X> and then overriding certain operations to provide
/// behavior specific to that transformation. For example, template
/// instantiation is implemented as a tree transformation where the
/// transformation of TemplateTypeParmType nodes involves substituting the
/// template arguments for their corresponding template parameters; a similar
/// transformation is performed for non-type template parameters and
/// template template parameters.
///
/// This tree-transformation template uses static polymorphism to allow
/// subclasses to customize any of its operations. Thus, a subclass can
/// override any of the transformation or rebuild operators by providing an
/// operation with the same signature as the default implementation. The
/// overridding function should not be virtual.
///
/// Semantic tree transformations are split into two stages, either of which
/// can be replaced by a subclass. The "transform" step transforms an AST node
/// or the parts of an AST node using the various transformation functions,
/// then passes the pieces on to the "rebuild" step, which constructs a new AST
/// node of the appropriate kind from the pieces. The default transformation
/// routines recursively transform the operands to composite AST nodes (e.g.,
/// the pointee type of a PointerType node) and, if any of those operand nodes
/// were changed by the transformation, invokes the rebuild operation to create
/// a new AST node.
///
/// Subclasses can customize the transformation at various levels. The
/// most coarse-grained transformations involve replacing TransformType(),
/// TransformExpr(), TransformDecl(), TransformNestedNameSpecifierLoc(),
/// TransformTemplateName(), or TransformTemplateArgument() with entirely
/// new implementations.
///
/// For more fine-grained transformations, subclasses can replace any of the
/// \c TransformXXX functions (where XXX is the name of an AST node, e.g.,
/// PointerType, StmtExpr) to alter the transformation. As mentioned previously,
/// replacing TransformTemplateTypeParmType() allows template instantiation
/// to substitute template arguments for their corresponding template
/// parameters. Additionally, subclasses can override the \c RebuildXXX
/// functions to control how AST nodes are rebuilt when their operands change.
/// By default, \c TreeTransform will invoke semantic analysis to rebuild
/// AST nodes. However, certain other tree transformations (e.g, cloning) may
/// be able to use more efficient rebuild steps.
///
/// There are a handful of other functions that can be overridden, allowing one
/// to avoid traversing nodes that don't need any transformation
/// (\c AlreadyTransformed()), force rebuilding AST nodes even when their
/// operands have not changed (\c AlwaysRebuild()), and customize the
/// default locations and entity names used for type-checking
/// (\c getBaseLocation(), \c getBaseEntity()).
