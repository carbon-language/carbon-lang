# We don't currently support building runtime libraries when we are
# cross-compiling. The issue is that we really want to be set up so that the
# available compiler targets are independent of the current build.
#
# Since we have to build the runtime libraries for the target, it requires we
# have a cross compiler from the build machine to the target. Although in the
# case where for the current build (host == target), we do have such a cross
# compiler, but not defined in a way that is easy for us to reuse. Regardless,
# that also wouldn't help for other possible compiler configurations.
#
# Thus, the simple set up we currently use is to assume that we will be using
# the just built Clang to compile the compiler-rt libraries. As we grow better
# cross compilation support inside Clang and tool support in LLVM, this makes it
# easier for us to achieve the goal of having the compiler targets be easily
# selected at configure time. However, this design does currently preclude the
# building of compiler-rt libraries when the Clang itself is being cross
# compiled.
#
# There are three possible solutions:
#  1. Require building a build-target version of Clang when cross compiling. This
#     is simplest, but als greatly increases the build time of cross builds.
#
#  2. Require cross builds have a build-target version of Clang available for
#     use. This is a reasonable compromise on #1, as the compiler-rt libraries
#     are simple enough that there is not a strong desire to ensure they are
#     built with the exact version of Clang being used. Similarly, as Clang
#     becomes a better cross compiler it is also increasingly more likely that
#     the cross compiler being used will already be a version of Clang.
#
#  3. Come up with an alternate mechanism to define all the toolchain
#     information that compiler-rt would need to build libraries for all the
#     requested targets. This might be a simple short term solution, but is
#     likely to be unwieldly and irritating to maintain in the long term.
