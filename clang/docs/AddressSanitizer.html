<h2 id="intro">Introduction</h2>
AddressSanitizer is a fast memory error detector.
It consists of a compiler instrumentation module and a run-time library.
The tool can detect the following types of bugs:
<ul> <li> Out-of-bounds accesses to  heap, stack and globals
  <li> Use-after-free
  <li> Use-after-return (to some extent)
  <li> Double-free, invalid free
</ul>
Typical slowdown introduced by AddressSanitizer is <b>2x</b>.

<h2 id="howtobuild">How to build</h2>
Follow the <a href="../get_started.html">clang build instructions</a>.
CMake build is supported.<BR>

<h2 id="usage">Usage</h2>
Simply compile and link your program with <tt>-faddress-sanitizer</tt> flag. <BR>
The AddressSanitizer run-time library should be linked to the final executable,
so make sure to use <tt>clang</tt> (not <tt>ld</tt>) for the final link step.<BR>
When linking shared libraries, the AddressSanitizer run-time is not linked,
so <tt>-Wl,-z,defs</tt> may cause link errors (don't use it with AddressSanitizer). <BR>

To get a reasonable performance add <tt>-O1</tt> or higher. <BR>
To get nicer stack traces in error messages add
<tt>-fno-omit-frame-pointer</tt>. <BR>
To get perfect stack traces you may need to disable inlining (just use <tt>-O1</tt>) and tail call
elimination (<tt>-fno-optimize-sibling-calls</tt>).

<pre>
% cat example_UseAfterFree.cc
int main(int argc, char **argv) {
  int *array = new int[100];
  delete [] array;
  return array[argc];  // BOOM
}
</pre>

<pre>
# Compile and link
% clang -O1 -g -faddress-sanitizer -fno-omit-frame-pointer example_UseAfterFree.cc
</pre>
OR
<pre>
# Compile
% clang -O1 -g -faddress-sanitizer -fno-omit-frame-pointer -c example_UseAfterFree.cc
# Link
% clang -g -faddress-sanitizer example_UseAfterFree.o
</pre>

If a bug is detected, the program will print an error message to stderr and exit with a
non-zero exit code.
Currently, AddressSanitizer does not symbolize its output, so you may need to use a
separate script to symbolize the result offline (this will be fixed in future).

<h3 id="has_feature">__has_feature(address_sanitizer)</h3>
In some cases one may need to execute different code depending on whether
AddressSanitizer is enabled.
<a href="LanguageExtensions.html#__has_feature_extension">__has_feature</a>
can be used for this purpose.
<pre>
#if defined(__has_feature)
# if __has_feature(address_sanitizer)
  code that builds only under AddressSanitizer
# endif
#endif
</pre>

<h3 id="no_address_safety_analysis">__attribute__((no_address_safety_analysis))</h3>
Some code should not be instrumented by AddressSanitizer.
One may use the function attribute
<a href="LanguageExtensions.html#address_sanitizer">
  <tt>no_address_safety_analysis</tt></a>
to disable instrumentation of a particular function.
This attribute may not be supported by other compilers, so we suggest to
use it together with <tt>__has_feature(address_sanitizer)</tt>.
Note: currently, this attribute will be lost if the function is inlined.

<h2 id="platforms">Supported Platforms</h2>
AddressSanitizer is supported on
<ul><li>Linux i386/x86_64 (tested on Ubuntu 10.04 and 12.04).
<li>MacOS 10.6, 10.7 and 10.8 (i386/x86_64).
</ul>
Support for Linux ARM (and Android ARM) is in progress
(it may work, but is not guaranteed too).


<h2 id="limitations">Limitations</h2>
<ul>
<li> AddressSanitizer uses more real memory than a native run.
Exact overhead depends on the allocations sizes. The smaller the
allocations you make the bigger the overhead is.
<li> AddressSanitizer uses more stack memory. We have seen up to 3x increase.
<li> On 64-bit platforms AddressSanitizer maps (but not reserves)
16+ Terabytes of virtual address space.
This means that tools like <tt>ulimit</tt> may not work as usually expected.
<li> Static linking is not supported.
</ul>


<h2 id="status">Current Status</h2>
AddressSanitizer is fully functional on supported platforms starting from LLVM 3.1.
The test suite is integrated into CMake build and can be run with
<tt>make check-asan</tt> command.
