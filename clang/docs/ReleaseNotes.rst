describe the status of Clang in some detail, including major
improvements from the previous release and new feature work. For the
general LLVM release notes, see `the LLVM
documentation <https://llvm.org/docs/ReleaseNotes.html>`_. All LLVM
releases may be downloaded from the `LLVM releases web

What's New in Clang 14.0.0?

Some of the major new features and improvements to Clang are listed

Attribute Changes in Clang
--------------------------

- Attributes loaded as clang plugins which are sensitive to LangOpts must
  now override ``acceptsLangOpts`` instead of ``diagLangOpts``.
  Returning false will produce a generic "attribute ignored" diagnostic, as
  with clang's built-in attributes.
  If plugins want to provide richer diagnostics, they can do so when the
  attribute is handled instead, e.g. in ``handleDeclAttribute``.
  (This was changed in order to better support attributes in code completion).

Windows Support
---------------

- An MSVC compatibility workaround for C++ operator names was removed. As a
  result, the ``<query.h>`` Windows SDK header may not compile out of the box.
  Users should use a recent SDK and pass ``-DQUERY_H_RESTRICTION_PERMISSIVE``
  or pass ``/permissive`` to disable C++ operator names altogether. See
  `PR42427 <https://llvm.org/pr42427>` for more info.

C Language Changes in Clang
---------------------------

- Wide multi-characters literals such as ``L'ab'`` that would previously be interpreted as ``L'b'``
  are now ill-formed in all language modes. The motivation for this change is outlined in
  `P2362 <wg21.link/P2362>`_.
- Support for ``__attribute__((error("")))`` and
  ``__attribute__((warning("")))`` function attributes have been added.
