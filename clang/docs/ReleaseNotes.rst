What's New in Clang 6.0.0?
==========================

Some of the major new features and improvements to Clang are listed
here. Generic improvements to Clang as a whole or to its underlying
infrastructure are described first, followed by language-specific
sections with improvements to Clang's support for those languages.

Major New Features
------------------

-  ...

Improvements to Clang's diagnostics
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- `-Wpragma-pack` is a new warning that warns in the following cases:
  - When a translation unit is missing terminating `#pragma pack (pop)`
    directives.
  - When leaving an included file that changes the current alignment value,
    i.e. when the alignment before `#include` is different to the alignment
    after `#include`.
  - `-Wpragma-pack-suspicious-include` (disabled by default) warns on an
    `#include` when the included file contains structures or unions affected by
    a non-default alignment that has been specified using a `#pragma pack`
    directive prior to the `#include`.
