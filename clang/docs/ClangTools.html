<h1>Clang Tools</h1>
<p>Clang Tools are standalone command line (and potentially GUI) tools design
for use by C++ developers who are already using and enjoying Clang as their
compiler. These tools provide developer-oriented functionality such as fast
syntax checking, automatic formatting, refactoring, etc.</p>

<p>Only a couple of the most basic and fundamental tools are kept in the primary
Clang Subversion project. The rest of the tools are kept in a side-project so
that developers who don't want or need to build them don't. If you want to get
access to the extra Clang Tools repository, simply check it out into the tools
tree of your Clang checkout and follow the usual process for building and
working with a combined LLVM/Clang checkout:</p>
<ul>
  <li>With Subversion:
  <ul>
    <li><tt>cd llvm/tools/clang/tools</tt></li>
    <li><tt>svn co http://llvm.org/svn/llvm-project/clang-tools-extra/trunk
      extra</tt></li>
  </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Or with Git:
  <ul>
    <li><tt>cd llvm/tools/clang/tools</tt></li>
    <li><tt>git clone http://llvm.org/git/clang-tools-extra.git extra</tt></li>
  </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>This document describes a high-level overview of the organization of Clang
Tools within the project as well as giving an introduction to some of the more
important tools. However, it should be noted that this document is currently
focused on Clang and Clang Tool developers, not on end users of these tools.</p>

<!-- ======================================================================= -->
<h2 id="org">Clang Tools Organization</h2>
<!-- ======================================================================= -->

<p>Clang Tools are CLI or GUI programs that are intended to be directly used by
C++ developers. That is they are <em>not</em> primarily for use by Clang
developers, although they are hopefully useful to C++ developers who happen to
work on Clang, and we try to actively dogfood their functionality. They are
developed in three components: the underlying infrastructure for building
a standalone tool based on Clang, core shared logic used by many different tools
in the form of refactoring and rewriting libraries, and the tools
themselves.</p>

<p>The underlying infrastructure for Clang Tools is the
<a href="LibTooling.html">LibTooling</a> platform. See its documentation for
much more detailed information about how this infrastructure works. The common
refactoring and rewriting toolkit-style library is also part of LibTooling
organizationally.</p>

<p>A few Clang Tools are developed along side the core Clang libraries as
examples and test cases of fundamental functionality. However, most of the tools
are developed in a side repository to provide easy separation from the core
libraries. We intentionally do not support public libraries in the side
repository, as we want to carefully review and find good APIs for libraries as
they are lifted out of a few tools and into the core Clang library set.</p>

<p>Regardless of which repository Clang Tools' code resides in, the development
process and practices for all Clang Tools are exactly those of Clang itself.
They are entirely within the Clang <em>project</em>, regardless of the version
control scheme.</p>


<!-- ======================================================================= -->
<h2 id="coretools">Core Clang Tools</h2>
<!-- ======================================================================= -->

<p>The core set of Clang tools that are within the main repository are tools
that very specifically compliment, and allow use and testing of <em>Clang</em>
specific functionality.</p>

<h3 id="clang-check"><tt>clang-check</tt></h3>
<p>This tool combines the LibTooling framework for running a Clang tool with the
basic Clang diagnostics by syntax checking specific files in a fast, command line
interface. It can also accept flags to re-display the diagnostics in different
formats with different flags, suitable for use driving an IDE or editor.</p>

<p>FIXME: Link to user-oriented clang-check documentation.</p>

<h3 id="clang-fixit"><tt>clang-fixit</tt> (Not yet implemented!)</h3>
<p>A tool which specifically applies the Clang fix-it hint diagnostic technology
on top of a dedicated tool. It is designed to explore alternative interfaces for
applying fix-it hints, including automatic application, prompting users with
options for different fixes, etc.</p>

<p><b>NB:</b> The clang-fixit tool is planned, but not yet implemented.</p>

<p>FIXME: Link to user-oriented clang-fixit documentation.</p>

<!-- ======================================================================= -->
<h2 id="registerplugin">Extra Clang Tools</h2>
<!-- ======================================================================= -->

<p>As various categories of Clang Tools are added to the extra repository,
they'll be tracked here. The focus of this documentation is on the scope and
features of the tools for other tool developers; each tool should provide its
own user-focused documentation.</p>
