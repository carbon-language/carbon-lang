# Verify compatability with older object files that didn't mark individual
# symbols as TLS.   In this case the symbol `bar` is being used in a TLS-only
# relocation (R_WASM_MEMORY_ADDR_TLS_SLEB) but is not itself marked as TLS.
# However, because it is defined in a section (`.mydata`) that *is* marked as
# TLS we implicitly mark bar as TLS.
#
# We had a regression where llvm-13-generated object files were being rejected
# with: "R_WASM_MEMORY_ADDR_TLS_SLEB cannot be used against non-TLS symbol"
# This test verifies that this error is not triggered.
