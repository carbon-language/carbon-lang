  ABSTRACT = {  Parallel computers are difficult to program efficiently.  We believe
  that a good way to help programmers write efficient programs is to
  provide them with tools that show them how their programs behave on
  a parallel computer.  Data distribution is the major performance
  factor of data-parallel programs and so automatic data layout for
  HPF programs has been studied by many researchers recently.  The
  communication volume induced by a data distribution is a good
  estimator of the efficiency of this data distribution.

  We present here a symbolic method to compute the communication
  volume generated by a given data distribution during the program
  writing phase (before compilation). We stay machine-independent to
  assure portability.  Our goal is to help the programmer understand
  the data movements its program generates and thus find a good data
  distribution. Our method is based on parametric polyhedral
  computations. It can be applied to a large class of regular codes.},

 abstract = {
In polyhedral compilation, various core concepts such as the set
of statement instances, the access relations, the dependences and
the schedule are represented or approximated using sets and binary
relations of sequences of integers bounded by (quasi-)affine constraints.
When these sets and relations are represented in disjunctive normal form,
it is important to keep the number of disjuncts small, both for efficiency
and to improve the computation of transitive closure overapproximations
and AST generation.  This paper describes the set coalescing operation
of isl that looks for opportunities to combine several disjuncts into
a single disjunct without affecting the elements in the set.  The main
purpose of the paper is to explain the various heuristics and to prove
their correctness.

 abstract = {
 Schedules in the polyhedral model, both those that represent the original
execution order and those produced by scheduling algorithms, naturally have the
form of a tree. Generic schedule representations proposed in the literature
encode this tree structure such that it is only implicitly available.
Following the internal representation of isl , we propose to represent
schedules as explicit trees and further extend the concept by introducing
different kinds of nodes. We compare our schedule trees to other
representations in detail and illustrate how they have been successfully used
to simplify the implementation of a non-trivial polyhedral compiler.
