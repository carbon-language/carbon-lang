	Commits:

	- make commits of logical units
	- check for unnecessary whitespace with "git diff --check"
	  before committing
	- do not check in commented out code or unneeded files
	- the first line of the commit message should be a short
	  description and should skip the full stop
	- the body should provide a meaningful commit message, which
	  includes motivation for the change, and contrasts
	  its implementation with previous behaviour
	- the lines of this body should have at most 76 columns
	- if you want your work included in isl.git, add a
	  "Signed-off-by: Your Name <you@example.com>" line to the
	  commit message (or just use the option "-s" when
	  committing) to confirm that you agree to the Developer's
	  Certificate of Origin
	- make sure that you have tests for the bug you are fixing
	- make sure that the test suite passes after your commit

	Patch:

	- use "git format-patch -M" to create the patch
	- do not PGP sign your patch
	- send a single patch per mail, e.g., using git-send-email(1)
	- do not attach your patch, but read in the mail
	  body, unless you cannot teach your mailer to
	  leave the formatting of the patch alone.
	- be careful doing cut & paste into your mailer, not to
	  corrupt whitespaces.
	- provide additional information (which is unsuitable for
	  the commit message) between the "---" and the diffstat
	- if you change, add, or remove a command line option or
	  make some other user interface change, the associated
	  documentation should be updated as well.
	- if your name is not writable in ASCII, make sure that
	  you send off a message in the correct encoding.
	- send the patch to the development mailing list
	  (isl-development@googlegroups.com).  If you use
	  git-send-email(1), please test it first by sending email
	  to yourself.

	Revisions:

	- add the revision number inside square brackets to
	  the subject line (e.g., use --subject-prefix='PATCH v2'
	  when creating the patch)
	- recall the major issues discovered during the previous
	  review and explain how you addressed them or why you
	  disagree.  Do so either in a cover letter, between the
	  "---" and the diffstat or in a separate message.
