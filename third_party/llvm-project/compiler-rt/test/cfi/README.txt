The tests in this directory use a common convention for exercising the
functionality associated with bit sets of different sizes. When certain
macros are defined the tests instantiate classes that force the bit sets
to be of certain sizes.

- B32 forces 32-bit bit sets.
- B64 forces 64-bit bit sets.
- BM forces memory bit sets.
