    The libc function is eventually available as a cc_library target by name

    it to the source list of the cc_library. This way, the C++ implementation
    and the C wrapper are both available in the cc_library.

    Args:
      name: Target name. It is normally the name of the function this target is
            for.
      srcs: The .cpp files which contain the function implementation.
      deps: The list of target dependencies if any.
      copts: The list of options to add to the C++ compilation command.
