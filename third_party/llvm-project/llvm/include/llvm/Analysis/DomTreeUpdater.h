  /// These methods provide APIs for submitting updates to the DominatorTree and
  /// the PostDominatorTree.
  ///
  /// Note: There are two strategies to update the DominatorTree and the
  /// PostDominatorTree:
  /// 1. Eager UpdateStrategy: Updates are submitted and then flushed
  /// immediately.
  /// 2. Lazy UpdateStrategy: Updates are submitted but only flushed when you
  /// explicitly call Flush APIs. It is recommended to use this update strategy
  /// when you submit a bunch of updates multiple times which can then
  /// add up to a large number of updates between two queries on the
  /// DominatorTree. The incremental updater can reschedule the updates or
  /// decide to recalculate the dominator tree in order to speedup the updating
  /// process depending on the number of updates.
  ///
  /// Although GenericDomTree provides several update primitives,
  /// it is not encouraged to use these APIs directly.

  /// Submit updates to all available trees.
  /// The Eager Strategy flushes updates immediately while the Lazy Strategy
  /// queues the updates.
  ///
  /// Note: The "existence" of an edge in a CFG refers to the CFG which DTU is
  /// in sync with + all updates before that single update.
  ///
  /// CAUTION!
  /// 1. It is required for the state of the LLVM IR to be updated
  /// *before* submitting the updates because the internal update routine will
  /// analyze the current state of the CFG to determine whether an update
  /// is valid.
