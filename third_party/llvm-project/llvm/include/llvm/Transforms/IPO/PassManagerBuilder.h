/// PassManagerBuilder - This class is used to set up a standard optimization
/// sequence for languages like C and C++, allowing some APIs to customize the
/// pass sequence in various ways. A simple example of using it would be:
///
///  PassManagerBuilder Builder;
///  Builder.OptLevel = 2;
///  Builder.populateFunctionPassManager(FPM);
///  Builder.populateModulePassManager(MPM);
///
/// In addition to setting up the basic passes, PassManagerBuilder allows
/// frontends to vend a plugin API, where plugins are allowed to add extensions
/// to the default pass manager.  They do this by specifying where in the pass
/// pipeline they want to be added, along with a callback function that adds
/// the pass(es).  For example, a plugin that wanted to add a loop optimization
/// could do something like this:
///
/// static void addMyLoopPass(const PMBuilder &Builder, PassManagerBase &PM) {
///   if (Builder.getOptLevel() > 2 && Builder.getOptSizeLevel() == 0)
///     PM.add(createMyAwesomePass());
/// }
///   ...
///   Builder.addExtension(PassManagerBuilder::EP_LoopOptimizerEnd,
///                        addMyLoopPass);
///   ...
