; It's tempting to have an instcombine in which the src pointer of a
; memcpy is aligned up to the alignment of the destination, however
; there are pitfalls. If the src is an alloca, aligning it beyond what
; the target's stack pointer is aligned at will require dynamic
; stack realignment, which can require functions that don't otherwise
; need a frame pointer to need one.
;
; Abstaining from this transform is not the only way to approach this
; issue. Some late phase could be smart enough to reduce alloca
; alignments when they are greater than they need to be. Or, codegen
; could do dynamic alignment for just the one alloca, and leave the
; main stack pointer at its standard alignment.
