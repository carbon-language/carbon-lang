; This test case was written to trigger an incorrect assert statement in
; -simplifycfg.  Thus we don't actually want to check the output, just that
; -simplifycfg -simplifycfg-require-and-preserve-domtree=1 ran successfully.  Thus we only check that the function still
; exists, and that it still calls foo().
;
; NOTE: There are some obviously dead blocks and missing branch weight
;       metadata.  Both of these features were key to triggering the assert.
;       Additionally, the not-taken weight of the branch with a weight had to
;       be 0 to trigger the assert.
