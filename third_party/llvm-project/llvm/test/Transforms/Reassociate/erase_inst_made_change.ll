; RUN: opt < %s -inline -reassociate -S | FileCheck %s

; This test case exposed a bug in reassociate where EraseInst's
; removal of a dead call wasn't recognized as changing the IR.
; So when runOnFunction propagated the "made changes" upwards
; to the CallGraphSCCPass it signalled that no changes had been
; made, so CallGraphSCCPass assumed that the old CallGraph,
; as known by that pass manager, still was up-to-date.
;
; This was detected as an assert when trying to remove the
; no longer used function 'bar' (due to incorrect reference
; count in the CallGraph).
