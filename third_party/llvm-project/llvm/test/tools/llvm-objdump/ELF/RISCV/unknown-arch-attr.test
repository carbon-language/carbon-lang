## Handle unrecognized arch attributes.
## Encode an unrecognized arch feature into an object file and try to decode it.
## The expected behavior is to ignore the unrecognized arch feature and
## continue to process the following arch features.
##
## The object file has the "rv32i2p0_x1p0_m2p0" arch feature. "x1p0" is an
## unrecognized architecture extension. llvm-objdump will ignore it and decode
## "mul" instruction correctly according to "m2p0" in the arch feature.
##
## This test cannot be assembly because the test needs an unrecognized arch
## feature and `llvm-mc` will filter out the unrecognized arch feature.
