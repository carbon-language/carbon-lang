# REQUIRES: x86-registered-target
## Basic test checking that update_test_checks.py works correctly
# RUN: cp -f %S/Inputs/basic.ll %t.ll && %update_test_checks %t.ll
# RUN: diff -u %t.ll %S/Inputs/basic.ll.expected
## Check that running the script again does not change the result:
# RUN: %update_test_checks %t.ll
# RUN: diff -u %t.ll %S/Inputs/basic.ll.expected
## Also try the --function-signature flag
# RUN: %update_test_checks %t.ll --function-signature
# RUN: diff -u %t.ll %S/Inputs/basic.ll.funcsig.expected
## Verify that running without the --function-signature flag does not removes
## the -SAME: lines since the generated file will have --function-signature in
## an UTC_ARGS: comment in the first line (from the invocation above) which is
## added to the update invocation below.
# RUN: %update_test_checks %t.ll
# RUN: diff -u %t.ll %S/Inputs/basic.ll.funcsig.expected
