Simple test built from this input which produces DWARF long enough to be compressed in the .[z]debug_info section:

  void f(int a, int b, int c, int d) {
  }

Since the compression is pretty orthogonal, we're not trying to test that the
compression library functioned correctly, just that dwp used it to decompress
the section - so test a few simple features and be done with it.
