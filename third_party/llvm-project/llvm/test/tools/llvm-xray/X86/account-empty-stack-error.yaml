# instrumented function does a 'fork()', where the child process will not see
# the entry record but see the exit record. This is completely valid data,
# which should be handled with grace (i.e. we treat it as an error, but since
# the llvm-xray account tool has an option to keep going, gives the user a
# chance to retry).
