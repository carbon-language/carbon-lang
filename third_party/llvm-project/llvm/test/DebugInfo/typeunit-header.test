RUN: llvm-dwarfdump -v %p/Inputs/typeunit-header.elf-x86-64 | FileCheck %s

This is testing a bugfix where parsing the type unit header was not 
taking the unit's intial length field into account when validating.

The input file is hand-coded assembler to generate a type unit stub,
which only contains a type unit DIE with a sole visibility attribute.

We make sure that llvm-dwarfdump is parsing the type unit header correctly
and displays it.
