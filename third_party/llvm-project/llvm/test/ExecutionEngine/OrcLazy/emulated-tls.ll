; Test that emulated-tls does not generate any unexpected errors.

; Unfortunately we cannot test successful execution of JIT'd code with
; emulated-tls as this would require the JIT itself, in this case lli, to be
; built with emulated-tls, which is not a common configuration. Instead we test
; that the only error produced by the JIT for a thread-local with emulated-tls
; enabled is a missing symbol error for __emutls_get_address. An unresolved
; reference to this symbol (and only this symbol) implies (1) that the emulated
; tls lowering was applied, and (2) that thread locals defined in the JIT'd code
; were otherwise handled correctly.

; CHECK: JIT session error: Symbols not found: [ {{[^,]*}}__emutls_get_address ]
