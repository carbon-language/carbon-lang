# RUN: llvm-jitlink -noexec %S/Inputs/MachO_x86-64_was_private_extern.o
#
# Perform a no-exec link of MachO_x86-64_was_private_extern.o and verify that
# it does not generate any errors despite the presence of a 'was private
# extern' symbol (N_PEXT set, N_EXT unset).
#
# The test case for this is a relocatable object file rather than assembly as
# objects must be run through ld64's 'ld -r' mode to produce them and we can't
# assume that that is available everywhere.
