; This test originally failed for MSA with a "Cannot select ..." error.
; This happened because the legalizer treated undef's in the <4 x float>
; constant as equivalent to the defined elements when checking if it a constant
; splat, but then proceeded to legalize the undef's to zero, leaving it as a
; non-splat that cannot be selected. It should have eliminated the undef's by
; rewriting the splat constant.

; It should at least successfully build.
