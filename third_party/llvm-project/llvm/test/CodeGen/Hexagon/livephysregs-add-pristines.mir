# The register r23 is live on the path bb.0->bb.2->bb.3. Make sure we add
# an implicit use of r23 to the predicated redefinition:
# CHECK: $r23 = A2_tfrt killed $p0, killed $r1, implicit killed $r23

# LivePhysRegs::addPristines could accidentally remove a callee-saved
# register, if it determined that it wasn't pristine. Doing that caused
# r23 in this testcase to be dropped from the Redefs set, and subsequently
# the necessary implicit use was not added for it.
