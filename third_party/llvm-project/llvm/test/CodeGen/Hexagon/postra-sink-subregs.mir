# 1. Post-RA machine sinking moves the copy (1) to block %bb.1. The
#    subregisters $r2 and $r3 of $d1 are not removed from the live-ins.
# 2. Expand post-RA pseudos replaces the COPY with A2_tfrp which is
#    predicable.
# 3. If-conversion predicates block %bb.1. Since $d1 (made of $r2 and $r3)
#    is in the live-in list to %bb.1, it assumes that $d1 in (1) is live,
#    and adds an implicit use of $d1 to the predicated copy.
#    This results in an invalid machine code, since the implicit use
#    refers to an undefined register.

# Make sure that post-RA machine sinking removes subregisters from live-ins
# to block bb.1.

# CHECK: $d1 = A2_tfrpf $p0, $d0
# CHECK-NOT: implicit killed $d1
