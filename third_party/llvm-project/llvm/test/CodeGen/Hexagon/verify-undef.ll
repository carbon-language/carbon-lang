; REQUIRES: asserts

; This test fails in the machine verifier because the verifier thinks the
; return register is undefined, and because there is a basic block that
; ends with an unconditional branch that is not marked as a barrier.
;
; Enabling SWP exposes these bugs because the live variable analysis is
; performed earlier than the process implicit def pass.  This ordering
; causes the JMPR machine instruction to contain two R0 operands, one
; with an undef and one with a kill flag.
