| How to organize the lit tests                                                |
+==============================================================================+

- If you write a test for matching a single DAG opcode or intrinsic, it should
  go in a file called {opcode_name,intrinsic_name}.ll (e.g. fadd.ll)

- If you write a test that matches several DAG opcodes and checks for a single
  ISA instruction, then that test should go in a file called {ISA_name}.ll (e.g.
  bfi_int.ll

- For all other tests, use your best judgement for organizing tests and naming
  the files.

- Use dash '-' and not underscore '_' to separate words in file names, unless
  the file is named after a DAG opcode or ISA instruction that has an
  underscore '_' in its name.
