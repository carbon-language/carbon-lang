; NOTE: In 2.4, it isn't explicitly written that a function always has a least

;       blocks in functions with a body, but that doesn't make much sense.
;       However, in order to distinguish between function declaration and
;       definition, a function needs at least one block, hence why this test
;       expects one OpLabel + OpReturn.
