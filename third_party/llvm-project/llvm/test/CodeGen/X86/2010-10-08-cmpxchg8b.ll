; On i386, i64 cmpxchg is lowered during legalize types to extract the
; 64-bit result into a pair of fixed regs. So creation of the DAG node
; happens in a different place. See
; X86TargetLowering::ReplaceNodeResults, case ATOMIC_CMP_SWAP.
;
; Neither Atomic-xx.ll nor atomic_op.ll cover this. Those tests were
; autogenerated from C source before 64-bit variants were supported.
;
; Note that this case requires a loop around the cmpxchg to force
; machine licm to query alias anlysis, exposing a bad
; MachineMemOperand.
