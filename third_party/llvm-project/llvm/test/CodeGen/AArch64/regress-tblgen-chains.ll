; When generating DAG selection tables, TableGen used to only flag an
; instruction as needing a chain on its own account if it had a built-in pattern
; which used the chain. This meant that the AArch64 load/stores weren't
; recognised and so both loads from %locvar below were coalesced into a single
; LS8_LDR instruction (same operands other than the non-existent chain) and the
; increment was lost at return.

; This was obviously a Bad Thing.
