# FIXME: This test should actually fail. Yaml-bench should report an error
# that a tab is being used to indent a plain scalar at line 15.
# We don't currently reject tabs as indentation.

# Tabs do's and don'ts:
# comment:
quoted: "Quoted		"
block: |
  void main() {
  	printf("Hello, world!\n");
  }
elsewhere:	# separation
	indentation, in	plain scalar


# CHECK: !!str "Quoted\t\t"
