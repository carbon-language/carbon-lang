:doc:`Projects`
  How-to guide and templates for new projects that *use* the LLVM

.. _lists-forums:

Forums & Mailing Lists
----------------------

If you can't find what you need in these docs, try consulting the
Discourse forums. There are also commit mailing lists for all commits to the LLVM Project.

`LLVM Discourse`__
  The forums for all things LLVM and related sub-projects. There are categories and subcategories for a wide variety of areas within LLVM. You can also view tags or search for a specific topic. 

  .. __: https://discourse.llvm.org/

`Commits Archive (llvm-commits)`__
  This list contains all commit messages that are made when LLVM developers
  commit code changes to the repository. It also serves as a forum for
  patch review (i.e. send patches here). It is useful for those who want to
  stay on the bleeding edge of LLVM development. This list is very high
  volume.

  .. __: http://lists.llvm.org/pipermail/llvm-commits/

`Bugs & Patches Archive (llvm-bugs)`__
  This list gets emailed every time a bug is opened and closed. It is
  higher volume than the LLVM-dev list.

  .. __: http://lists.llvm.org/pipermail/llvm-bugs/

`LLVM Announcements`__
  If you just want project wide announcements such as releases, developers meetings, or blog posts, then you should check out the Announcement category on LLVM Discourse. 

  .. __: https://discourse.llvm.org/c/announce/46 

.. _online-sync-ups:

Online Sync-Ups
---------------

A number of regular calls are organized on specific topics. It should be
expected that the range of topics will change over time. At the time of
writing, the following sync-ups are organized:

Office hours
------------

A number of experienced LLVM contributors make themselves available for a chat
on a regular schedule, to anyone who is looking for some guidance. Please find
the list of who is available when, through which medium, and what their area of
expertise is. Don't be too shy to dial in!

Of course, people take time off from time to time, so if you dial in and you
don't find anyone present, chances are they happen to be off that day.

Guidance for office hours hosts
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* If you're interested in becoming an office hours host, please add your
  information to the list above.
* When starting an office hours session, consider typing something like "*Hi,
  I'm available for chats in the next half hour at* video chat URL. *I'm
  looking forward to having conversations on the video chat or here.*" on the
  LLVM chat channels that you are already on. These could include:

    * the `#office-hours Discord channel
      <https://discord.com/channels/636084430946959380/976196303681896538>`__.
    * :ref:`IRC`

  Doing this can help:
    * overcome potential anxiety to call in for a first time,
    * people who prefer to first exchange a few messages through text chat
      before dialing in, and
    * remind the wider community that office hours do exist.
* If you decide to no longer host office hours, please do remove your entry
  from the list above.


.. _IRC:

IRC
---

Users and developers of the LLVM project (including subprojects such as Clang)
can be found in #llvm on `irc.oftc.net <irc://irc.oftc.net/llvm>`_.

This channel has several bots.

* Buildbot reporters

  * llvmbb - Bot for the main LLVM buildbot master.
    http://lab.llvm.org/buildbot/#/console

* robot - Bugzilla linker. %bug <number>

* clang-bot - A `geordi <http://www.eelis.net/geordi/>`_ instance running
  near-trunk clang instead of gcc.

In addition to the traditional IRC there is a
`Discord <https://discord.com/channels/636084430946959380/636725486533345280>`_
