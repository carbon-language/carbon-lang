     These are in-progress notes for the upcoming LLVM |version| release.
     Release notes for previous releases can be found on
     `the Download Page <https://releases.llvm.org/download.html>`_.


Introduction
============

This document contains the release notes for the LLVM Compiler Infrastructure,
release |release|.  Here we describe the status of LLVM, including major improvements
from the previous release, improvements in various subprojects of LLVM, and
some of the current users of the code.  All LLVM releases may be downloaded
from the `LLVM releases web site <https://llvm.org/releases/>`_.

For more information about LLVM, including information about the latest
release, please check out the `main LLVM web site <https://llvm.org/>`_.  If you
have questions or comments, the `LLVM Developer's Mailing List
<https://lists.llvm.org/mailman/listinfo/llvm-dev>`_ is a good place to send
them.

Note that if you are reading this file from a Git checkout or the main
LLVM web page, this document applies to the *next* release, not the current
one.  To see the release notes for a specific release, please see the `releases
page <https://llvm.org/releases/>`_.

Non-comprehensive list of changes in this release
=================================================
.. NOTE
   For small 1-3 sentence descriptions, just add an entry at the end of
   this list. If your description won't fit comfortably in one bullet
   point (e.g. maybe you would like to give an example of the
   functionality, or simply have a lot to talk about), see the `NOTE` below
   for adding a new subsection.

Update on required toolchains to build LLVM
-------------------------------------------

With LLVM 15.x we will raise the version requirements of the toolchain used
to build LLVM. The new requirements are as follows:

* GCC >= 7.1
* Clang >= 5.0
* Apple Clang >= 9.3
* Visual Studio 2019 >= 16.7

In LLVM 15.x these requirements will be "soft" requirements and the version
check can be skipped by passing -DLLVM_TEMPORARILY_ALLOW_OLD_TOOLCHAIN=ON
to CMake.

With the release of LLVM 16.x these requirements will be hard and LLVM developers
can start using C++17 features, making it impossible to build with older
versions of these toolchains.

Changes to the LLVM IR
----------------------

Changes to building LLVM
------------------------

* Omitting ``CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE`` when using a single configuration generator is now
  an error. You now have to pass ``-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=<type>`` in order to configure
  LLVM. This is done to help new users of LLVM select the correct type: since building
  LLVM in Debug mode is very resource intensive, we want to make sure that new users
  make the choice that lines up with their usage. We have also improved documentation
  around this setting that should help new users. You can find this documentation
  `here <https://llvm.org/docs/CMake.html#cmake-build-type>`_.

Changes to TableGen
-------------------

Changes to the AArch64 Backend
------------------------------

Changes to the AMDGPU Backend
-----------------------------

* 8 and 16-bit atomic loads and stores are now supported


Changes to the ARM Backend
--------------------------

* Added support for the Armv9-A, Armv9.1-A and Armv9.2-A architectures.
* Added support for the Armv8.1-M PACBTI-M extension.
* Added support for the Armv9-A, Armv9.1-A and Armv9.2-A architectures.
* Added support for the Armv8.1-M PACBTI-M extension.
* Removed the deprecation of ARMv8-A T32 Complex IT blocks. No deprecation
  warnings will be generated and -mrestrict-it is now always off by default.
  Previously it was on by default for Armv8 and off for all other architecture
  versions.
* Added a pass to workaround Cortex-A57 Erratum 1742098 and Cortex-A72
  Erratum 1655431. This is enabled by default when targeting either CPU.
* Implemented generation of Windows SEH unwind information.
* Switched the MinGW target to use SEH instead of DWARF for unwind information.

Changes to the AVR Backend
--------------------------

* ...

Changes to the Hexagon Backend
------------------------------

* ...

Changes to the MIPS Backend
---------------------------

* ...

Changes to the PowerPC Backend
------------------------------

* ...

Changes to the RISC-V Backend
-----------------------------

* The Zvfh extension was added.

Changes to the WebAssembly Backend
----------------------------------

* ...

Changes to the X86 Backend
--------------------------

* ...

Changes to the OCaml bindings
-----------------------------


Changes to the C API
--------------------

* Add ``LLVMGetCastOpcode`` function to aid users of ``LLVMBuildCast`` in
  resolving the best cast operation given a source value and destination type.
  This function is a direct wrapper of ``CastInst::getCastOpcode``.

Changes to the Go bindings
--------------------------


Changes to the FastISel infrastructure
--------------------------------------

* ...

Changes to the DAG infrastructure
---------------------------------


Changes to the Debug Info
---------------------------------

During this release ...

Changes to the LLVM tools
---------------------------------

Changes to LLDB
---------------------------------

* The "memory region" command now has a "--all" option to list all
  memory regions (including unmapped ranges). This is the equivalent
  of using address 0 then repeating the command until all regions
  have been listed.
* Added "--show-tags" option to the "memory find" command. This is off by default.
  When enabled, if the target value is found in tagged memory, the tags for that
  memory will be shown inline with the memory contents.
* Various memory related parts of LLDB have been updated to handle
  non-address bits (such as AArch64 pointer signatures):

  * "memory read", "memory write" and "memory find" can now be used with
    addresses with non-address bits.
  * All the read and write memory methods on SBProccess and SBTarget can
    be used with addreses with non-address bits.
  * When printing a pointer expression, LLDB can now dereference the result
    even if it has non-address bits.
  * The memory cache now ignores non-address bits when looking up memory
    locations. This prevents us reading locations multiple times, or not
    writing out new values if the addresses have different non-address bits.

Changes to Sanitizers
---------------------


Other Changes
-------------
* The code for the `LLVM Visual Studio integration
  <https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=LLVMExtensions.llvm-toolchain>`_
  has been removed. This had been obsolete and abandoned since Visual Studio
  started including an integration by default in 2019.
