/// \class Communication Communication.h "lldb/Core/Communication.h" An
/// abstract communications class.
///
/// Communication is an class that handles data communication between two data
/// sources. It uses a Connection class to do the real communication. This
/// approach has a couple of advantages: it allows a single instance of this
/// class to be used even though its connection can change. Connections could
/// negotiate for different connections based on abilities like starting with
/// Bluetooth and negotiating up to WiFi if available. It also allows this
/// class to be subclassed by any interfaces that don't want to give bytes but
/// want to validate and give out packets. This can be done by overriding:
///
/// AppendBytesToCache (const uint8_t *src, size_t src_len, bool broadcast);
///
/// Communication inherits from Broadcaster which means it can be used in
/// conjunction with Listener to wait for multiple broadcaster objects and
/// multiple events from each of those objects. Communication defines a set of
/// pre-defined event bits (see enumerations definitions that start with
/// "eBroadcastBit" below).
///
/// There are two modes in which communications can occur:
///     \li single-threaded
///     \li multi-threaded
///
/// In single-threaded mode, all reads and writes happen synchronously on the
/// calling thread.
///
/// In multi-threaded mode, a read thread is spawned that continually reads
/// data and caches any received bytes. To start the read thread clients call:
///
///     bool Communication::StartReadThread (Status *);
///
/// If true is returned a read thread has been spawned that will continually
/// execute a call to the pure virtual DoRead function:
///
///     size_t Communication::ReadFromConnection (void *, size_t, uint32_t);
///
/// When bytes are received the data gets cached in \a m_bytes and this class
/// will broadcast a \b eBroadcastBitReadThreadGotBytes event. Clients that
/// want packet based communication should override AppendBytesToCache. The
/// subclasses can choose to call the built in AppendBytesToCache with the \a
/// broadcast parameter set to false. This will cause the \b
/// eBroadcastBitReadThreadGotBytes event not get broadcast, and then the
/// subclass can post a \b eBroadcastBitPacketAvailable event when a full
/// packet of data has been received.
///
/// If the connection is disconnected a \b eBroadcastBitDisconnected event
/// gets broadcast. If the read thread exits a \b
/// eBroadcastBitReadThreadDidExit event will be broadcast. Clients can also
/// post a \b eBroadcastBitReadThreadShouldExit event to this object which
/// will cause the read thread to exit.
