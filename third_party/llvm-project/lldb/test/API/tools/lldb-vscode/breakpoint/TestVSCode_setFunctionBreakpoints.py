        '''Tests setting and clearing function breakpoints.
           This packet is a bit tricky on the debug adaptor side since there
           is no "clearFunction Breakpoints" packet. Function breakpoints
           are set by sending a "setFunctionBreakpoints" packet with zero or
           more function names. If function breakpoints have been set before,
           any existing breakpoints must remain set, and any new breakpoints
           must be created, and any breakpoints that were in previous requests
           and are not in the current request must be removed. This function
           tests this setting and clearing and makes sure things happen
           correctly. It doesn't test hitting breakpoints and the functionality
           of each breakpoint, like 'conditions' and 'hitCondition' settings.
