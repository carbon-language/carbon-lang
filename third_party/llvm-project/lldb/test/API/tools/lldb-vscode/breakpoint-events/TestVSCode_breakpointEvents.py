            This test sets a breakpoint in a shared library and runs and stops
            at the entry point of a program. When we stop at the entry point,
            the shared library won't be loaded yet. At this point the
            breakpoint should set itself, but not be verified because no
            locations are resolved. We will then continue and expect to get a
            breakpoint event that informs us that the breakpoint in the shared
            library is "changed" and the correct line number should be
            supplied. We also set a breakpoint using a LLDB command using the
            "preRunCommands" when launching our program. Any breakpoints set via
            the command interpreter should not be have breakpoint events sent
            back to VS Code as the UI isn't able to add new breakpoints to
            their UI. Code has been added that tags breakpoints set from VS Code
            DAP packets so we know the IDE knows about them. If VS Code is ever
            able to register breakpoints that aren't initially set in the GUI,
            then we will need to revise this.
