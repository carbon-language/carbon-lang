# Default messages, embedded into the OpenMP RTL, and source for English catalog.


# Compatible changes (which does not require version bumping):
#     * Editing message (number and type of placeholders must remain, relative order of
#       placeholders may be changed, e.g. "File %1$s line %2$d" may be safely edited to
#       "Line %2$d file %1$s").
#     * Adding new message to the end of section.
# Incompatible changes (version must be bumbed by 1):
#     * Introducing new placeholders to existing messages.
#     * Changing type of placeholders (e.g. "line %1$d" -> "line %1$s").
#     * Rearranging order of messages.
#     * Deleting messages.
# Use special "OBSOLETE" pseudoidentifier for obsolete entries, which is kept only for backward
# compatibility. When version is bumped, do not forget to delete all obsolete entries.
