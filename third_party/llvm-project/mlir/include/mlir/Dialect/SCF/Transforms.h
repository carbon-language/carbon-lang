/// into a for loop where the step divides the iteration space evenly, followed
/// by another scf.for for the last (partial) iteration (if any; returned via
/// `partialIteration`). This transformation is called "loop peeling".
///
/// This transformation is beneficial for a wide range of transformations such
/// as vectorization or loop tiling: It enables additional canonicalizations
/// inside the peeled loop body such as rewriting masked loads into unmaked
/// loads.
///
/// E.g., assuming a lower bound of 0 (for illustration purposes):
/// ```
/// scf.for %iv = %c0 to %ub step %c4 {
///   (loop body)
/// }
/// ```
/// is rewritten into the following pseudo IR:
/// ```
/// %newUb = %ub - (%ub mod %c4)
/// scf.for %iv = %c0 to %newUb step %c4 {
///   (loop body)
/// }
/// scf.for %iv2 = %newUb to %ub {
///   (loop body)
/// }
/// ```
///
/// After loop peeling, this function tries to simplify/canonicalize affine.min
/// and affine.max ops in the body of the peeled loop and in the body of the
/// partial iteration loop, taking advantage of the fact that the peeled loop
/// has only "full" iterations. This canonicalization is expected to enable
/// further canonicalization opportunities through other patterns.
///
/// The return value indicates whether the loop was rewritten or not. Loops are
/// not rewritten if:
/// * Loop step size is 1 or
/// * Loop bounds and step size are static, and step already divides the
///   iteration space evenly.
///
/// Note: This function rewrites the given scf.for loop in-place and creates a
/// new scf.for operation for the last iteration. It replaces all uses of the
/// unpeeled loop with the results of the newly generated scf.for.
