  let description = [{
    This op may have an arbitrary number of regions, each of which represents a
    sequence of transform operations to be applied to the same payload IR. The
    regions are visited in order of appearance, and transforms in them are
    applied in their respective order of appearance. If one of these transforms
    fails to apply, the remaining ops in the same region are skipped an the next
    region is attempted. If all transformations in a region succeed, the
    remaining regions are skipped and the entire "alternatives" transformation
    succeeds. If all regions contained a failing transformation, the entire
    "alternatives" transformation fails.

    It is up to the nested operations to define which errors are "recoverable"
    (or "silencable") and allow another alternatives to be attempted, and which
    errors should be propagated without attempting the other alternatives.

    The single operand of this operation is the scope in which the alternative
    transformation sequences are attempted, that is, an operation in the payload
    IR that contains all the other operations that may be modified by the
    transformations. There is no check that the transforms are indeed scoped
    as their "apply" methods can be arbitrarily complex. Therefore it is the
    responsibility of the user to ensure that the transforms are scoped
    correctly, or to produce an irrecoverable error and thus abort the execution
    without attempting the remaining alternatives. Note that the payload IR
    outside of the given scope is not necessarily in the valid state, or even
    accessible to the tranfsormation.
    
    The changes to the IR within the scope performed by transforms in the failed
    alternative region are reverted before attempting the next region.
    Practically, this is achieved by cloning the scope. Therefore it is advised
    to limit the scope as much as possible and place the most likely
    alternatives early in the region list. The operation is also isolated from
    above and requires rediscovering the operations within the given scope to
    avoid additional handle invalidation. The latter restriction may be lifted
    in the future.

    Each of the regions may yield transform IR handles. The handles of the first
    successful alternative region are returned as the results of the
    "alternatives" op. Therefore, each alternative region must yield the same
    number of results, which should also match the number and the types of the
    "alternatives" op results.

    Remark: this op allows one to implement a simple "try" construct as follows:

    ```mlir
    %result = transform.alternatives %scope {
    ^bb0(%arg0: !pdl.operation):
      // Try a failible transformation.
      %0 = transform.failible %arg0 // ...
      // If succeeded, yield the the result of the transformation.
      transform.yield %0 : !pdl.operation
    }, {
    ^bb0(%arg0: !pdl.operation):
      // Otherwise, the second alternative is tried and it always succeeeds by
      // returning the original handle.
      transform.yield %arg0 : !pdl.operation
    }
    ```

  let description = [{
    The handles defined by this Transform op correspond to the closest isolated
    from above ancestor of the Payload IR operations associated with its
    operand. If any of the given Payload IR ops has no such parent (unlikely as
    there usually is a top-level ModuleOp), the transformation is considered to
    have failed.

    Ancestor ops follow the same order as the ops assocaited with the
    operand, except for potential duplicates (multiple Payload IR ops assocaited
    with the operand have the same parent) for which the ancestor will only be
    listed once for the first time it occurs. For example, given the list
    "(childof(A), childof(B), childof(B), childof(A), childof(B))", the
    resulting list will be just "(A, B)". Note that no other semantic ordering
    is applied, e.g., "B" may itself be a parent of "A". This may have an impact
    on the further transformation applied to the handle produced here.

    If the operand is assocaited with multiple Payload IR ops, finds matching
    ops nested within each of those and produces a single list containing all
    of the matched ops.

    The tranfsormation is considered successful regardless of whether some
    Payload IR ops actually matched the pattern and only fails if the pattern
    could not be looked up or compiled.

    This op contains a set of named PDL patterns that are available for the
    Transform dialect operations to be used for pattern matching. For example,
    PDLMatchOp can be used to produce a Transform IR value associated with all
    Payload IR operations that match the pattern as follows:

    ```mlir
    transform.with_pdl_patterns {
    ^bb0(%arg0: !pdl.operation):
      pdl.pattern @my_pattern : benefit(1) {
        %0 = pdl.operation //...

        %1 = pdl_match @my_pattern in %arg1
        // Use %1 as handle

    }

    Note that the pattern is expected to finish with a `pdl.rewrite` terminator
    that points to the custom rewriter named "transform.dialect". The rewriter
    actually does nothing, but the transform application will keep track of the
    operations that matched the pattern.

    another Transform dialect operation that gets executed with all patterns
    available. This op is a possible top-level Transform IR op, the argument of
