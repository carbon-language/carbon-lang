/// tuple of integer values attached to every point in the polyhedron, with the
/// value of each element of the tuple given by an affine expression in the ids
/// of the polyhedron. For example we could have the domain
///
/// (x, y) : (x >= 5, y >= x)
///
/// and a tuple of three integers defined at every point in the polyhedron:
///
/// (x, y) -> (x + 2, 2*x - 3y + 5, 2*x + y).
///
/// In this way every point in the polyhedron has a tuple of integers associated
/// with it. If the integer polyhedron has local ids, then the output
/// expressions can use them as well. The output expressions are represented as
/// a matrix with one row for every element in the output vector one column for
/// each id, and an extra column at the end for the constant term.
///
/// Checking equality of two such functions is supported, as well as finding the
/// value of the function at a specified point. Note that local ids in the
/// domain are not yet supported for finding the value at a point.
