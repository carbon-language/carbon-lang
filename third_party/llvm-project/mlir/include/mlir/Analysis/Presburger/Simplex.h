/// The Simplex class implements a version of the Simplex and Generalized Basis
/// Reduction algorithms, which can perform analysis of integer sets with affine
/// inequalities and equalities. A Simplex can be constructed
/// by specifying the dimensionality of the set. It supports adding affine
/// inequalities and equalities, and can perform emptiness checks, i.e., it can
/// find a solution to the set of constraints if one exists, or say that the
/// set is empty if no solution exists. Furthermore, it can find a subset of
/// these constraints that are redundant, i.e. a subset of constraints that
/// doesn't constrain the affine set further after adding the non-redundant
/// constraints. The LexSimplex class provides support for computing the
/// lexicographical minimum of an IntegerPolyhedron. Both these classes can be
/// constructed from an IntegerPolyhedron, and both inherit common
/// functionality from SimplexBase.
///
/// The implementations of the Simplex and SimplexBase classes, other than the
/// functionality for obtaining an integer sample, are based on the paper
/// "Simplify: A Theorem Prover for Program Checking"
/// by D. Detlefs, G. Nelson, J. B. Saxe.
///
/// We define variables, constraints, and unknowns. Consider the example of a
/// two-dimensional set defined by 1 + 2x + 3y >= 0 and 2x - 3y >= 0. Here,
/// x, y, are variables while 1 + 2x + 3y >= 0, 2x - 3y >= 0 are constraints.
/// Unknowns are either variables or constraints, i.e., x, y, 1 + 2x + 3y >= 0,
/// 2x - 3y >= 0 are all unknowns.
///
/// The implementation involves a matrix called a tableau, which can be thought
/// of as a 2D matrix of rational numbers having number of rows equal to the
/// number of constraints and number of columns equal to one plus the number of
/// variables. In our implementation, instead of storing rational numbers, we
/// store a common denominator for each row, so it is in fact a matrix of
/// integers with number of rows equal to number of constraints and number of
/// columns equal to _two_ plus the number of variables. For example, instead of
/// storing a row of three rationals [1/2, 2/3, 3], we would store [6, 3, 4, 18]
/// since 3/6 = 1/2, 4/6 = 2/3, and 18/6 = 3.
///
/// Every row and column except the first and second columns is associated with
/// an unknown and every unknown is associated with a row or column. An unknown
/// associated with a row or column is said to be in row or column orientation
/// respectively. As described above, the first column is the common
/// denominator. The second column represents the constant term, explained in
/// more detail below. These two are _fixed columns_; they always retain their
/// position as the first and second columns. Additionally, LexSimplex stores
/// a so-call big M parameter (explained below) in the third column, so
/// LexSimplex has three fixed columns.
///
/// LexSimplex does not directly support variables which can be negative, so we
/// introduce the so-called big M parameter, an artificial variable that is
/// considered to have an arbitrarily large value. We then transform the
/// variables, say x, y, z, ... to M, M + x, M + y, M + z. Since M has been
/// added to these variables, they are now known to have non-negative values.
/// For more details, see the documentation for LexSimplex. The big M parameter
/// is not considered a real unknown and is not stored in the `var` data
/// structure; rather the tableau just has an extra fixed column for it just
/// like the constant term.
///
/// The vectors var and con store information about the variables and
/// constraints respectively, namely, whether they are in row or column
/// position, which row or column they are associated with, and whether they
/// correspond to a variable or a constraint.
///
/// An unknown is addressed by its index. If the index i is non-negative, then
/// the variable var[i] is being addressed. If the index i is negative, then
/// the constraint con[~i] is being addressed. Effectively this maps
/// 0 -> var[0], 1 -> var[1], -1 -> con[0], -2 -> con[1], etc. rowUnknown[r] and
/// colUnknown[c] are the indexes of the unknowns associated with row r and
/// column c, respectively.
///
/// The unknowns in column position are together called the basis. Initially the
/// basis is the set of variables -- in our example above, the initial basis is
/// x, y.
///
/// The unknowns in row position are represented in terms of the basis unknowns.
/// If the basis unknowns are u_1, u_2, ... u_m, and a row in the tableau is
/// d, c, a_1, a_2, ... a_m, this represents the unknown for that row as
/// (c + a_1*u_1 + a_2*u_2 + ... + a_m*u_m)/d. In our running example, if the
/// basis is the initial basis of x, y, then the constraint 1 + 2x + 3y >= 0
/// would be represented by the row [1, 1, 2, 3].
///
/// The association of unknowns to rows and columns can be changed by a process
/// called pivoting, where a row unknown and a column unknown exchange places
/// and the remaining row variables' representation is changed accordingly
/// by eliminating the old column unknown in favour of the new column unknown.
/// If we had pivoted the column for x with the row for 2x - 3y >= 0,
/// the new row for x would be [2, 1, 3] since x = (1*(2x - 3y) + 3*y)/2.
/// See the documentation for the pivot member function for details.
///
/// The association of unknowns to rows and columns is called the _tableau
/// configuration_. The _sample value_ of an unknown in a particular tableau
/// configuration is its value if all the column unknowns were set to zero.
/// Concretely, for unknowns in column position the sample value is zero; when
/// the big M parameter is not used, for unknowns in row position the sample
/// value is the constant term divided by the common denominator. When the big M
/// parameter is used, if d is the denominator, p is the big M coefficient, and
/// c is the constant term, then the sample value is (p*M + c)/d. Since M is
/// considered to be positive infinity, this is positive (negative) infinity
/// when p is positive or negative, and c/d when p is zero.
///
/// The tableau configuration is called _consistent_ if the sample value of all
/// restricted unknowns is non-negative. Initially there are no constraints, and
/// the tableau is consistent. When a new constraint is added, its sample value
/// in the current tableau configuration may be negative. In that case, we try
/// to find a series of pivots to bring us to a consistent tableau
/// configuration, i.e. we try to make the new constraint's sample value
/// non-negative without making that of any other constraints negative. (See
/// findPivot and findPivotRow for details.) If this is not possible, then the
/// set of constraints is mutually contradictory and the tableau is marked
/// _empty_, which means the set of constraints has no solution.
///
/// This SimplexBase class also supports taking snapshots of the current state
/// and rolling back to prior snapshots. This works by maintaining an undo log
/// of operations. Snapshots are just pointers to a particular location in the
/// log, and rolling back to a snapshot is done by reverting each log entry's
/// operation from the end until we reach the snapshot's location. SimplexBase
/// also supports taking a snapshot including the exact set of basis unknowns;
/// if this functionality is used, then on rolling back the exact basis will
/// also be restored. This is used by LexSimplex because its algorithm, unlike
/// Simplex, is sensitive to the exact basis used at a point.

/// M + x, M + y, M + z, which are now guaranteed to be non-negative. See the

/// just considered to be infinite throughout and it never appears in the final
/// outputs. We will deal with sample values throughout that may in general be
/// some linear expression involving M like pM + q or aM + b. We can compare
/// these with each other. They have a total order:
/// aM + b < pM + q iff a < p or (a == p and b < q).
/// In particular, aM + b < 0 iff a < 0 or (a == 0 and b < 0).
///
/// Initially all the constraints to be added are added as rows, with no attempt
/// to keep the tableau consistent. Pivots are only performed when some query
/// is made, such as a call to getRationalLexMin. Care is taken to always
/// maintain a lexicopositive basis transform, explained below.
///
/// Let the variables be x = (x_1, ... x_n). Let the basis unknowns at a
/// particular point be  y = (y_1, ... y_n). We know that x = A*y + b for some
/// n x n matrix A and n x 1 column vector b. We want every column in A to be
/// lexicopositive, i.e., have at least one non-zero element, with the first
/// such element being positive. This property is preserved throughout the
/// operation of LexSimplex. Note that on construction, the basis transform A is
/// the indentity matrix and so every column is lexicopositive. Note that for
/// LexSimplex, for the tableau to be consistent we must have non-negative
/// sample values not only for the constraints but also for the variables.
/// So if the tableau is consistent then x >= 0 and y >= 0, by which we mean
/// every element in these vectors is non-negative. (note that this is a
/// different concept from lexicopositivity!)
///
/// When we arrive at a basis such the basis transform is lexicopositive and the
/// tableau is consistent, the sample point is the lexiographically minimum
/// point in the polytope. We will show that A*y is zero or lexicopositive when
/// y >= 0. Adding a lexicopositive vector to b will make it lexicographically
/// bigger, so A*y + b is lexicographically bigger than b for any y >= 0 except
/// y = 0. This shows that no point lexicographically smaller than x = b can be
/// obtained. Since we already know that x = b is valid point in the space, this
/// shows that x = b is the lexicographic minimum.
///
/// Proof that A*y is lexicopositive or zero when y > 0. Recall that every
/// column of A is lexicopositive. Begin by considering A_1, the first row of A.
/// If this row is all zeros, then (A*y)_1 = (A_1)*y = 0; proceed to the next
/// row. If we run out of rows, A*y is zero and we are done; otherwise, we
/// encounter some row A_i that has a non-zero element. Every column is
/// lexicopositive and so has some positive element before any negative elements
/// occur, so the element in this row for any column, if non-zero, must be
/// positive. Consider (A*y)_i = (A_i)*y. All the elements in both vectors are
/// non-negative, so if this is non-zero then it must be positive. Then the
/// first non-zero element of A*y is positive so A*y is lexicopositive.
///
/// Otherwise, if (A_i)*y is zero, then for every column j that had a non-zero
/// element in A_i, y_j is zero. Thus these columns have no contribution to A*y
/// and we can completely ignore these columns of A. We now continue downwards,
/// looking for rows of A that have a non-zero element other than in the ignored
/// columns. If we find one, say A_k, once again these elements must be positive
/// since they are the first non-zero element in each of these columns, so if
/// (A_k)*y is not zero then we have that A*y is lexicopositive and if not we
/// ignore more columns; eventually if all these dot products become zero then
/// A*y is zero and we are done.
