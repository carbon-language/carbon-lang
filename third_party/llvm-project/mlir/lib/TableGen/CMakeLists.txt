# This library is unusual, since mlir-tblgen depends on it, which is
# built with DISABLE_LLVM_LINK_LLVM_DYLIB, this must also be built
# with that option.  Otherwise builds with LLVM_BUILD_LLVM_DYLIB and
# LLVM_LINK_LLVM_DYLIB fail.  (Note that even if this has no llvm
# component dependencies, LLVM_LINK_LLVM_DYLIB tends to introduce a
# dependence on libLLVM.so)  However, it must also be linkable against
# libMLIR.so in some contexts (see unittests/Tablegen, for instance, which
# has a dependence on MLIRIR, which must depend on libLLVM.so).  This works
# in this special case because this library is static.
