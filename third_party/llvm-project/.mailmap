# This file allows mapping several author and committer email addresses and
# names to a single canonical one for `git shortlog`, `git log --author`,
# or `git check-mailmap`.
#
# For example, if you commit as `random.person@example.com` but sometimes use
# "Rañdom Person" and sometimes "Random Person" as name and you want the former
# to be your canonical name, add
#
#     Rañdom Person <random.person@example.com>
#
# If you commit as both `random.person@example.com` and `ranp@example.com` and
# you want the former to be your canonical email address, add
#
#     <random.person@example.com> <ranp@example.com>
#
# Combinations of both are possible too, see
# https://git-scm.com/docs/gitmailmap for format details.
#
# You can commit changes for your own names and  email addresses without review.
# If you want to add entries for other people, please have them review the
# addition.
#
# Please keep this file sorted.
