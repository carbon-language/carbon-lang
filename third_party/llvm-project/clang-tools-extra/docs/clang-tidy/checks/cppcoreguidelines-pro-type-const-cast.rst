cppcoreguidelines-pro-type-const-cast
=====================================

This check flags all uses of ``const_cast`` in C++ code.

Modifying a variable that was declared const is undefined behavior, even with
``const_cast``.

This rule is part of the "Type safety" profile of the C++ Core Guidelines, see
https://github.com/isocpp/CppCoreGuidelines/blob/master/CppCoreGuidelines.md#Pro-type-constcast.
