bugprone-lambda-function-name
=============================

Checks for attempts to get the name of a function from within a lambda
expression. The name of a lambda is always something like ``operator()``, which
is almost never what was intended.

Example:

.. code-block:: c++

  void FancyFunction() {
    [] { printf("Called from %s\n", __func__); }();
    [] { printf("Now called from %s\n", __FUNCTION__); }();
  }

Output::

  Called from operator()
  Now called from operator()

Likely intended output::

  Called from FancyFunction
  Now called from FancyFunction
