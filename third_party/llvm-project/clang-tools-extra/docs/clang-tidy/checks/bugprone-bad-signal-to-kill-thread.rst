bugprone-bad-signal-to-kill-thread
==================================

Finds ``pthread_kill`` function calls when a thread is terminated by 
raising ``SIGTERM`` signal and the signal kills the entire process, not 
just the individual thread. Use any signal except ``SIGTERM``.

.. code-block: c++

    pthread_kill(thread, SIGTERM);

This check corresponds to the CERT C Coding Standard rule
`POS44-C. Do not use signals to terminate threads
<https://wiki.sei.cmu.edu/confluence/display/c/POS44-C.+Do+not+use+signals+to+terminate+threads>`_.
