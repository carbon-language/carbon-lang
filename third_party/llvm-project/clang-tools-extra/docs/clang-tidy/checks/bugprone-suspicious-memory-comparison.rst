bugprone-suspicious-memory-comparison
=====================================

Finds potentially incorrect calls to ``memcmp()`` based on properties of the
arguments. The following cases are covered:

**Case 1: Non-standard-layout type**

Comparing the object representations of non-standard-layout objects may not
properly compare the value representations.

**Case 2: Types with no unique object representation**

Objects with the same value may not have the same object representation.
This may be caused by padding or floating-point types.
