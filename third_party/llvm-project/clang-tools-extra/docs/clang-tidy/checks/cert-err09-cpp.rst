cert-err09-cpp
==============

The cert-err09-cpp check is an alias, please see
`misc-throw-by-value-catch-by-reference <misc-throw-by-value-catch-by-reference.html>`_
for more information.

This check corresponds to the CERT C++ Coding Standard recommendation
ERR09-CPP. Throw anonymous temporaries. However, all of the CERT recommendations
have been removed from public view, and so their justification for the behavior
of this check requires an account on their wiki to view.
