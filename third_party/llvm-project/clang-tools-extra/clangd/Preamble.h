// The vast majority of code in a typical translation unit is in the headers
// included at the top of the file.
//
// The preamble optimization says that we can parse this code once, and reuse
// the result multiple times. The preamble is invalidated by changes to the
// code in the preamble region, to the compile command, or to files on disk.
//
// This is the most important optimization in clangd: it allows operations like
// code-completion to have sub-second latency. It is supported by the
// PrecompiledPreamble functionality in clang, which wraps the techniques used
// by PCH files, modules etc into a convenient interface.
