# REQUIRES: zlib
This test tries to parse a checked-in binary index.
If this test fails it means there has been a backward incompatilbe change to
serialization format.
Please bump the version number in
clang-tools-extra/clangd/index/Serialization.cpp and regenarate sample.idx with

  clangd-indexer \
    clang-tools-extra/clangd/test/index-serialization/Inputs/sample.cpp > \
    clang-tools-extra/clangd/test/index-serialization/Inputs/sample.idx

Also if you've introduced new slabs/chunks to serialized index, make sure
indexing sample.cpp would yield non-trivial values for those.
# RUN: dexp %/S/Inputs/sample.idx -c="find B" | grep Bar || not grep -v '^#' %s
