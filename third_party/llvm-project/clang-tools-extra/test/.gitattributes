# CRLF (Windows) line endings take two bytes instead of one, so any tests that
# rely on or check fixed character -offset, Offset: or FileOffset: locations
# will fail when run on input files checked out with different line endings.

# These test input files rely on one-byte Unix (LF) line-endings, as they use
# fixed -offset, FileOffset:, or Offset: numbers in their tests.
