# This file describes the various pre-commit CI bots used to test libc++.
#
# This file should never contain logic -- all the logic must be offloaded
# into scripts. This is critical to being able to reproduce CI issues outside
# of the CI environment, which is important for debugging.
#
# It is also worth noting that this script is split into several sections, the
# goal being to reduce the load on testers when a commit is known to fail.
#

steps:

  # Light pre-commit tests for things like formatting or when people forget
  # to update generated files.
