// Clang 9 or 10 changed the handling of method lists so that methods provided
// from synthesised properties showed up in the method list, where previously
// CGObjCGNU had to collect them and merge them.  One of the places where this
// merging happened was missed in the move and so we ended up emitting two
// copies of method metadata for declared properties.

// This class has only instance properties and only one pair of synthesized
// methods from the property and so we should synthesize only one method list,
// with precisely two methods on it.
