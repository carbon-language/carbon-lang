++ SVE ACLE Warnings ++

When the ASM check lines fail in the SVE ACLE tests it most likely means you
have introduced a warning due to:
1. Adding an invalid call to VectorType::getNumElements() or EVT::getVectorNumElements()
   when the type is a scalable vector.
2. Relying upon an implicit cast conversion from TypeSize to uint64_t.

For generic code, please modify your code to work with ElementCount and TypeSize directly.
For target-specific code that only deals with fixed-width vectors, use the fixed-size interfaces.
Please refer to the code where those functions live for more details.
