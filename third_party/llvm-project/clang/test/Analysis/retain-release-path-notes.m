/***
This file is for testing the path-sensitive notes for retain/release errors.
Its goal is to have simple branch coverage of any path-based diagnostics,
not to actually check all possible retain/release errors.

This file includes notes that only appear in a ref-counted analysis. 
GC-specific notes should go in retain-release-path-notes-gc.m.
