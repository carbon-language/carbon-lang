What's New in Clang 14.0.0?
===========================

Some of the major new features and improvements to Clang are listed
here. Generic improvements to Clang as a whole or to its underlying
infrastructure are described first, followed by language-specific
sections with improvements to Clang's support for those languages.

Major New Features
------------------

-  ...

Improvements to Clang's diagnostics
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- -Wbitwise-instead-of-logical (part of -Wbool-operation) warns about use of bitwise operators with boolean operands which have side effects.

- Added diagnostic groups to control diagnostics for attribute extensions by
  adding groups ``-Wc++N-attribute-extensions`` (where ``N`` is the standard
  release being diagnosed against). These new groups are automatically implied
  when passing ``-Wc++N-extensions``. Resolves PR33518.

Non-comprehensive list of changes in this release
-------------------------------------------------

- Maximum _ExtInt size was decreased from 16,777,215 bits to 8,388,608 bits.
  Motivation for this was discussed in PR51829.
- Configuration file syntax extended with ``<CFGDIR>`` token. This expands to
  the base path of the current config file. See :ref:`configuration-files` for
  details.

New Compiler Flags
------------------

- Clang plugin arguments can now be passed through the compiler driver via
  ``-fplugin-arg-pluginname-arg``, similar to GCC's ``-fplugin-arg``.

Deprecated Compiler Flags
-------------------------

- -Wweak-template-vtables has been deprecated and no longer has any effect. The
  flag will be removed in the next release.

Modified Compiler Flags
-----------------------

- Support has been added for the following processors (``-mcpu`` identifiers in parentheses):

  - RISC-V SiFive E20 (``sifive-e20``).
  - RISC-V SiFive E21 (``sifive-e21``).
  - RISC-V SiFive E24 (``sifive-e24``).
  - RISC-V SiFive E34 (``sifive-e34``).
  - RISC-V SiFive S21 (``sifive-s21``).
  - RISC-V SiFive S51 (``sifive-s51``).
  - RISC-V SiFive S54 (``sifive-s54``).
  - RISC-V SiFive S76 (``sifive-s76``).

- Support has been added for the following architectures (``-march`` identifiers in parentheses):

  - Armv9-A (``armv9-a``).
  - Armv9.1-A (``armv9.1-a``).
  - Armv9.2-A (``armv9.2-a``).

Removed Compiler Flags

New Pragmas in Clang
--------------------

- ...

Attribute Changes in Clang
--------------------------

- Attributes loaded as clang plugins which are sensitive to LangOpts must
  now override ``acceptsLangOpts`` instead of ``diagLangOpts``.
  Returning false will produce a generic "attribute ignored" diagnostic, as
  with clang's built-in attributes.
  If plugins want to provide richer diagnostics, they can do so when the
  attribute is handled instead, e.g. in ``handleDeclAttribute``.
  (This was changed in order to better support attributes in code completion).

- __has_cpp_attribute, __has_c_attribute, __has_attribute, and __has_declspec
  will now macro expand their argument. This causes a change in behavior for
  code using ``__has_cpp_attribute(__clang__::attr)`` (and same for
  ``__has_c_attribute``) where it would previously expand to ``0`` for all
  attributes, but will now issue an error due to the expansion of the
  predefined ``__clang__`` macro.

Windows Support
---------------

- An MSVC compatibility workaround for C++ operator names was removed. As a
  result, the ``<query.h>`` Windows SDK header may not compile out of the box.
  Users should use a recent SDK and pass ``-DQUERY_H_RESTRICTION_PERMISSIVE``
  or pass ``/permissive`` to disable C++ operator names altogether. See
  `PR42427 <https://llvm.org/pr42427>` for more info.

C Language Changes in Clang
---------------------------

- The value of ``__STDC_VERSION__`` has been bumped to ``202000L`` when passing
  ``-std=c2x`` so that it can be distinguished from C17 mode. This value is
  expected to change again when C23 is published.
- Wide multi-characters literals such as ``L'ab'`` that would previously be interpreted as ``L'b'``
  are now ill-formed in all language modes. The motivation for this change is outlined in
  `P2362 <wg21.link/P2362>`_.
- Support for ``__attribute__((error("")))`` and
  ``__attribute__((warning("")))`` function attributes have been added.
- The maximum allowed alignment has been increased from 2^29 to 2^32.
- Clang now supports the ``_BitInt(N)`` family of bit-precise integer types
  from C23. This type was previously exposed as ``_ExtInt(N)``, which is now a
  deprecated alias for ``_BitInt(N)`` (so diagnostics will mention ``_BitInt``
  even if source uses ``_ExtInt``). ``_BitInt(N)`` and ``_ExtInt(N)`` are the
  same types in all respects beyond spelling and the deprecation warning.
  ``_BitInt(N)`` is supported as an extension in older C modes and in all C++
  modes. Note: the ABI for ``_BitInt(N)`` is still in the process of being
  stabilized, so this type should not yet be used in interfaces that require
  ABI stability.
- When using ``asm goto`` with outputs whose constraint modifier is ``"+"``, we
  now change the numbering of the labels to occur after hidden tied inputs for
  better compatibility with GCC.  For better portability between different
  compilers and versions, symbolic references rather than numbered references
  should be preferred. See
  `this thread <https://gcc.gnu.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=103640>` for more
  info.

C++ Language Changes in Clang
-----------------------------

- ...

C++20 Feature Support
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
...

C++2b Feature Support
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
- Implemented `P1938R3: if consteval <https://wg21.link/P1938R3>`_.
- Implemented `P2360R0: Extend init-statement to allow alias-declaration <https://wg21.link/P2360R0>`_.


CUDA Language Changes in Clang
------------------------------

- Clang now supports CUDA versions up to 11.5.
- Default GPU architecture has been changed from sm_20 to sm_35.

Objective-C Language Changes in Clang
-------------------------------------

OpenCL C Language Changes in Clang
----------------------------------

...

ABI Changes in Clang
--------------------

- The ``_ExtInt(N)`` extension has been standardized in C23 as ``_BitInt(N)``.
  The mangling of this type in C++ has accordingly changed: under the Microsoft
  ABI it is now mangled using the ``_BitInt`` spelling, and under the Itanium ABI
  it is now mangled using a dedicated production. Note: the ABI for ``_BitInt(N)``
  is still in the process of being stabilized, so this type should not yet be
  used in interfaces that require ABI stability.

OpenMP Support in Clang
-----------------------

- ``clang-nvlink-wrapper`` tool introduced to support linking of cubin files archived in an archive. See :doc:`ClangNvlinkWrapper`.


CUDA Support in Clang
---------------------

- ...

X86 Support in Clang
--------------------

- Support for ``AVX512-FP16`` instructions has been added.

Arm and AArch64 Support in Clang
--------------------------------

- Support has been added for the following processors (command-line identifiers in parentheses):
  - Arm Cortex-A510 (``cortex-a510``)
  - Arm Cortex-X2 (``cortex-x2``)
  - Arm Cortex-A710 (``cortex-A710``)

- The -mtune flag is no longer ignored for AArch64. It is now possible to
  tune code generation for a particular CPU with -mtune without setting any
  architectural features. For example, compiling with
  "-mcpu=generic -mtune=cortex-a57" will not enable any Cortex-A57 specific
  architecture features, but will enable certain optimizations specific to
  Cortex-A57 CPUs and enable the use of a more accurate scheduling model.


Floating Point Support in Clang
-------------------------------
- The default setting of FP contraction (FMA) is now -ffp-contract=on (for
  languages other than CUDA/HIP) even when optimization is off. Previously,
  the default behavior was equivalent to -ffp-contract=off (-ffp-contract
  was not set).
  Related to this, the switch -ffp-model=precise now implies -ffp-contract=on
  rather than -ffp-contract=fast, and the documentation of these features has
  been clarified. Previously, the documentation claimed that -ffp-model=precise
  was the default, but this was incorrect because the precise model implied
  -ffp-contract=fast, whereas the (now corrected) default behavior is
  -ffp-contract=on.
  -ffp-model=precise is now exactly the default mode of the compiler.
- -fstrict-float-cast-overflow no longer has target specific behavior. Clang
  will saturate towards the smallest and largest representable integer values.
  NaNs will be converted to zero.

Internal API Changes
--------------------

- A new sugar ``Type`` AST node represents types accessed via a C++ using
  declaration. Given code ``using std::error_code; error_code x;``, ``x`` has
  a ``UsingType`` which desugars to the previous ``RecordType``.

Build System Changes
--------------------

- Linux distros can specify ``-DCLANG_DEFAULT_PIE_ON_LINUX=On`` to use ``-fPIE`` and
  ``-pie`` by default. This matches GCC installations on many Linux distros
  (configured with ``--enable-default-pie``).
  (`D113372 <https://reviews.llvm.org/D113372>`_)

AST Matchers
------------

- ``TypeLoc`` AST Matchers are now available. These matchers provide helpful
  utilities for matching ``TypeLoc`` nodes, such as the ``pointerTypeLoc``
  matcher or the ``hasReturnTypeLoc`` matcher. The addition of these matchers
  was made possible by changes to the handling of ``TypeLoc`` nodes that
  allows them to enjoy the same static type checking as other AST node kinds.
- ``LambdaCapture`` AST Matchers are now available. These matchers allow for
  the binding of ``LambdaCapture`` nodes. The ``LambdaCapture`` matchers added
  include the ``lambdaCapture`` node matcher, the ``capturesVar`` traversal
  matcher, and ``capturesThis`` narrowing matcher.
- The ``hasAnyCapture`` matcher now only accepts an inner matcher of type
  ``Matcher<LambdaCapture>``. The matcher originally accepted an inner matcher
  of type ``Matcher<CXXThisExpr>`` or ``Matcher<VarDecl>``.
- The ``usingType`` matcher is now available and needed to refer to types that
  are referred to via using C++ using declarations.
  The associated ``UsingShadowDecl`` can be matched using ``throughUsingDecl``
  and the underlying ``Type`` with ``hasUnderlyingType``.
  ``hasDeclaration`` continues to see through the alias and apply to the
  underlying type.

clang-format
------------

- Option ``AllowShortEnumsOnASingleLine: false`` has been improved, it now
  correctly places the opening brace according to ``BraceWrapping.AfterEnum``.

- Option ``QualifierAlignment`` has been added in order to auto-arrange the
  positioning of specifiers/qualifiers
  `const` `volatile` `static` `inline` `constexpr` `restrict`
  in variable and parameter declarations to be either ``Right`` aligned
  or ``Left`` aligned or ``Custom`` using ``QualifierOrder``.

- Option ``QualifierOrder`` has been added to allow the order
  `const` `volatile` `static` `inline` `constexpr` `restrict`
  to be controlled relative to the `type`.

- Option ``SeparateDefinitionBlocks`` has been added to insert or remove empty
  lines between definition blocks including functions, classes, structs, enums,
  and namespaces.

- Add a ``Custom`` style to ``SpaceBeforeParens``, to better configure the
  space before parentheses. The custom options can be set using
  ``SpaceBeforeParensOptions``.

- The command line argument `-style=<string>` has been extended so that a specific
  format file at location <format_file_path> can be selected. This is supported
  via the syntax: `-style=file:<format_file_path>`.

- Improved C++20 Modules and Coroutines support.

- Option ``AfterOverloadedOperator`` has been added in ``SpaceBeforeParensOptions``
  to allow space between overloaded operator and opening parentheses.
