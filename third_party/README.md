The `/third_party` directory is for any code that doesn't follow Carbon's normal
contribution rules, and thus requires special care. The intent is that code
_not_ under `/third_party` should not require special contribution rules.

Examples of code belonging under `/third_party` include:

-   Code not licensed under the standard
    [Apache-2.0 WITH LLVM-exception license](/LICENSE).
-   Code which is maintained externally or imported from another repository.
-   Code which is not fully under
    [Carbon's CLA](/CONTRIBUTING.md#contributor-license-agreements-clas).
