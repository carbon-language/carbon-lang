# Contributing to LLVM

Thank you for your interest in contributing to LLVM! There are many ways to
contribute, and we appreciate all contributions.

To get started with contributing, please take a look at the
[Contributing to LLVM](https://llvm.org/docs/Contributing.html) guide. It
describes how to get involved, raise issues and submit patches. Please note
that at the moment the LLVM project does not use either Github pull requests
or Github issues.
