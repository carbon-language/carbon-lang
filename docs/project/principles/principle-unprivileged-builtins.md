## Principle

Carbon libraries should be able to make new types that have all the same
capabilities as builtin types, including the syntax for use. This allows:

- By allowing new types to be developed in libraries, we allow the ecosystem to
  evolve without requiring heavyweight modifications to the language itself. See
  [Carbon Goals: Both software and language evolution](https://github.com/jonmeow/carbon-lang/blob/proposal-goals/docs/project/goals.md#both-software-and-language-evolution).
- A form of orthogonality which aids simplicity. See
  [Carbon Goals: Code that is simple and easy to read, understand, and write](https://github.com/jonmeow/carbon-lang/blob/proposal-goals/docs/project/goals.md#code-that-is-easy-to-read-understand-and-write).

**Background:**
[Swift implements all builtin types in Swift itself](https://github.com/apple/swift/tree/master/stdlib/public/core).
The implementations of types like `Int8` do involve LLVM intrinsics to perform
addition, etc., but because they are defined as ordinary Swift types, they
guarantee that they are not special.

### Caveats

- Possibly (still to be decided) this will not extend to operations like `&&`
  and `||` that can control whether their arguments get evaluated. (Note: Swift
  has a mechanism called `@autoclosure` for arguments that may not be evaluated,
  it is uncertain whether Carbon will have a similar mechanism.)
- One capability we likely won't support for non-builtins: having a name in the
  global namespace.
- There will be convenient syntax for writing literals for builtin types, which
  we don't feel obligated to support for non-builtins.

## Applications of these principles

We will support operator overloading, so a built-in type can define how `+`,
etc. work. There should not be any operation that works on built-in types that
can't be defined for library types.

We will support inheriting from built-in types.
