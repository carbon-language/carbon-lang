These documents explain the principles by which we judge proposed changes to the
language. This is to achieve many goals:

- Establish and document agreement within the project of its language design
  principles.
- Clearly communicate expectations to contributors.
- Encourage us to solve problems in a consistent way.
- Provide a yardstick for measuring different proposals.

Note that these principles seek to establish both what the project aims to
achieve as well as approaches we want to exclude.
