## Principle

Our goal is not merely for Carbon to be a good language in general, but for it
to be specifically a good choice as the target of large-scale tool-assisted migration from
C++. A large migration can never be atomic, so high-fidelity and
high-performance interoperability between C++ and Carbon will have to be part of
the migration strategy. It must be possible to rewrite a C++ library as Carbon
without having to rewrite its dependencies or its clients, and a mixed
C++/Carbon program must have adequate performance.

Note, however, that the interoperability doesn't necessarily have to be
convenient. Once we have passed the threshold that incremental migration is
possible, we have a choice of how much we reduce migration costs and how
convenient we make the interoperability. To give examples from other languages:
we want C++/Carbon interoperability to have fewer rough edges than C++/Java or
C++/Rust, but it doesn't necessarily have to be as seamless as
Java/Kotlin or Objective-C/Swift. Interoperability may sometimes be in tension with
other goals, like performance, safety, and ergonomics. We're willing to
sacrifice some level of interoperability convenience, even if C++ and Carbon
code at the language boundary might sometimes have to be awkward and
non-idiomatic, if it's important for achieving those goals.

## Application of these principles

These are non-exhaustive examples of design decisions where we are and are not
willing to compromise on C++/Carbon interoperability for the sake of other goals
like performance, safety, and Carbon ergonomics.

* Concrete C++ types should be usable from Carbon, and vice versa, at least on
  an opt-in basis. Possibly not all C++ types need be usable from Carbon, only
  ones tagged in some special way, but in any case crossing the language
  boundary should not require copying data to adhere to a different memory
  layout. At an implementation level, this might mean that a Carbon ABI has
  multiple memory layout strategies, one of which is C++'s, just as a C++
  compiler today supports multiple calling conventions for the sake of
  interoperability with C and other languages.
   * C++ classes with private member variables and virtual functions should work
     in Carbon.
   * C++ protocol buffers should work in Carbon.
   * C++ vocabulary types like `std::string`, `std::vector`, `std::tuple`, and
     `absl::flat_hash_map` should work in Carbon.

* Many C++ libraries have an API where a client is expected to supply an object
  that inherits from a specific abstract base class, so it should be possible
  for a Carbon struct to implement a C++ interface.
   * This doesn't necessarily mean that Carbon must have inheritance of
     implementation as a first-class feature. We might decide that this applies
     only to pure C++ interface classes, and that C++ "interfaces" with
     implementation must be rewritten for the Carbon migration.
   * Whether Carbon needs to have "classes" in the C++ sense remains to be seen:
     we need to make it possible for concrete Carbon types to be usable from
     C++, and it remains to be seen whether that can be done if Carbon doesn't
     have classes.

* Carbon doesn't need to have exactly the same set of primitive integer types as
  C++, so long as it's possible to know which Carbon type(s) a C++ integer type
  maps to, given a target platform (including relevant compiler choices and
  build flags).

* Carbon doesn't have to support C++ exceptions, still less throwing exceptions
  across the C++/Carbon boundary.  Carbon could, for example, take the same
  approach that
  [Swift does](https://github.com/apple/swift/blob/master/docs/CppInteroperabilityManifesto.md#implementation):
  if C++ code throws an exception that propagates into a Carbon stack frame, we
  terminate the program.

* Carbon's design for object lifetime and aliasing will be made for the sake of
  performance and safety, even if that means conflicting with C++ rules. For
  example, Carbon need not adopt C++ rules about lifetimes of temporaries (that
  lifetimes of temporaries are extended to a full expression) and could adopt
  stricter rules, even though that would require more care in using some C++
  APIs from Carbon.
   * As an example: a C++ program might pass the return value of `absl::StrCat`
     to a function whose parameter is `std::string_view`, and C++ guarantees
     that the temporary object's lifetime is long enough. If Carbon has
     different lifetime rules, then it will be harder to use such a C++ function
     safely from Carbon.

* It should be possible to use Carbon's parameterized types with concrete C++
  types. For example, there should be some way of putting C++ objects in Carbon
  containers like vectors or hash maps.
   * Since Carbon container types are likely to use generics, this implies that
     there should be some way of instantiating Carbon generics with C++
     types. This doesn't necessarily mean that using a C++ type with a Carbon
     generic has to be as convenient as using a Carbon type with a Carbon
     generic: we might imagine requiring some kind of wrapper or declaration, so
     long as it doesn't impose too much boilerplate or performance overhead.

* Since C++ libraries and vocabulary types are frequently written in terms of
  templates, it should be possible to instantiate C++ templates with Carbon
  types. We expect that complicated C++ metaprogramming libraries will need to
  be rewritten by hand (the goal is to support the 95% case), but we shouldn't
  require a full rewrite for clients of template code.
   * Is CRTP complicated enough to not support using it from Carbon? It is
     pretty common, but supporting CRTP across C++/Carbon boundary requires us
     to intertwine C++ and Carbon template instantiation.

* C++ type traits should work correctly on Carbon types.

* Carbon code should be able to use C++ APIs that are defined in terms of
  incomplete types.
   * However, Carbon code will not necessarily be able to define incomplete
     types with exactly the same look and feel as in C++. Carbon might satisfy
     these use cases with a different language feature.
