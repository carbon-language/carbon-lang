This team owns and drives the project's Code of Conduct, questions, concerns,
and conduct reports. This page is for the _team_, see our actual
[Code of Conduct](/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) for the code and reporting details.

## Contact and current team members

be used for questions, concerns, or reports of specific conduct issues.

For more details, please see the
[reporting conduct](/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md#reporting-conduct) documentation.

## Team structure and updates

The Conduct Team's goal is to have at least 5 trained conduct team members to
deal with conduct-related escalations on behalf of and for the Carbon community.
There should always be at least 3 conduct team members available to respond
promptly, even factoring in vacations, getting sick, or other normal
disruptions.

The Conduct Team is responsible for recruiting new members as needed to achieve
these goals, and when trained and ready, the team will directly update this
documentation and add them to the respective infrastructure.

The Conduct Team is typically recruited from among our active moderators -- if
you are interested, reach out to any of the moderators to get involved.
