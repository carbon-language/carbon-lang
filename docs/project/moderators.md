## Overview

Moderation is primarily focused on Carbon's Discord and GitHub, but generally
applies to the [collaboration systems](/CONTRIBUTING.md#collaboration-systems).
Moderators are empowered to improve community discussion and enforce the
[Code of Conduct](/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). Conduct decisions are ultimately the
domain of the [Conduct team](/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md#conduct-team), although
moderators will often act in order to protect the community.

All moderators will have the "moderator" role on Discord. Some moderators are
_senior moderators_, and will have extra privileges to help address harmful
conduct. Senior moderators will have the "senior-moderator" role on Discord.

## Becoming a moderator

TODO: Need to figure out right process.

The Conduct team will review new moderators.

## Promotion to senior moderator

Moderators will be considered for promotion to senior moderators when:

-   They have demonstrated that they will be active moderators.
-   They are making decisions consistent with the
    [Code of Conduct](/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).
-   Senior moderators are taking actions which require senior moderator
    privileges at the moderator's request.

The Conduct team will review promotions to senior moderator.

## Moderation powers

There is a moderation playbook for moderators with instructions on how to use
these powers.

-   **Discord**

    -   **Delete message** (senior): Delete a message owned by another user.

    -   **Timeout user** (all): Prevent a user from sending messages on the
        Discord server for up to a week.

    -   **Kick user** (senior): Temporarily remove a user from the Discord
        server. Note that users can rejoin the server, and so banning is
        typically preferred.

    -   **Ban user** (senior): Permanently remove a user from the Discord
        server.

    -   **Slow-mode** (senior): Limit the rate of discussion on a channel.

        -   Slow-mode is tied to the ability to generically edit channels.
            Moderators are generally expected to use the channel edit power
            judiciously, preferring to leave channel edits for admins.

-   **GitHub**

    -   **Lock conversation** (all): Prevent more discussion on a topic.

    -   **Hide message** (all): Collapses a message so that its text is not
        immediately visible, reducing distractions. Recommended for moderators
        when a particular message is unproductive. Users can still view the
        original content.

        -   This cannot be done with the first message in a conversation.

    -   **Edit message** (all): Edits content of a message. Users can still view
        the original content.

    -   **Edit title** (all): Edits the title of a thread.

    -   **Delete message** (all): Removes a single message from a conversation.
        Hiding or editing messages is preferred.

        -   This cannot be done to the first message in a conversation.

    -   **Block user** (senior): Blocks a user from all repositories.

-   **Google Docs**

    -   There are limited powers for moderators on Google Docs, but access to
        Google Docs is already restricted. At present, the right action is to
        respond or comment on an issue as needed, and report to the Conduct team
        if further steps are necessary.
