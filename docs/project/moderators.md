## Overview

Moderation is primarily focused on Carbon's Discord and GitHub, but generally
applies to the [collaboration systems](/CONTRIBUTING.md#collaboration-systems).
Moderators are empowered to improve community discussion and enforce the
[Code of Conduct](/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). Conduct decisions are ultimately the
domain of the [Conduct team](/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md#conduct-team), although
moderators will often act in order to protect the community.

All moderators will have the "moderator" role on Discord. Some moderators are
_senior moderators_, and will have extra privileges to help address harmful
conduct. Senior moderators will have the "senior-moderator" role on Discord.

There are limited powers for moderators on Google Docs, but access to Google

comment on an issue as needed, and report to the Conduct team if further steps
are necessary.
