## Objective for 2023: Issue 2132 Resolved and Regression Testing Potential Explored

eeshvardasikcm has two primary goals for 2023:

-   Issue 2132 is resolved.
-   Regression testing potential is explored and maybe benchmark regression.

### Completing Issue 2132

By the end of 2023, a PR that intends to close issue 2023 needs to be
submitted. Eeshvardasikcm is planning on submitting a simple PR soon with only
one or two little tests added to verify that the string literal issue even
exists.

Closure of issue 2132 may be possible 'prematurely' if this roadmap,
is referenced to from within the PR,
and this roadmap has evolved to outline a clear path to completion of working
regression testing.

The goal is that if any string literal bugs concerning line ending tabs appear
after the closure of this issue,
then the regression testing system should be able to either catch the bug or
be manually informed of any new bugs.

### Regression Testing and Benchmark Regressions Potential

The potential of maintaining this sub-team roadmap format is great.
Eeshvardasikcm intends to carry everything from this issue 2132 forward into
other issues and PR's that he makes.

Hopefully, this sub-team concept will be acceptable. There is mention in the
main Carbon Project Roadmap that sub-teams may be created. Eeshvardasikcm
believes that using his project management skills and creating his own
sub-team, are important for him to finish this issue 2132 and continue on
contributing to Carbon Project using this new regression testing and roadmap
format.

## Key results in 2023

There are several milestones that we believe are on the critical path to
successfully achieving our main goal for the year, and point to concrete areas
of focus for the project.

This issue number 2132 is a "good first issue" that eeshvardasikcm has been
working on. As soon as he is completed with this issue, he will enjoy getting
caught up to discuss and contribute to other issues.

### Broaden Potential for increased Contributor Participation

eeshvardasikcm was commenting on GitHub with one of the leads about this
issue. The lead asked for this issue to also do regression testing if
possible. It is Possible for eeshvardasikcm to do regression testing.

Benchmarking should be integrated with regression testing. There's no reason
to allow fast code to become slower.

This issue can be assigned to someone else. Eeshvardasikcm would not mind at
all. Eeshvardasikcm is currently working on this issue and is not sure how
quickly Carbon leads want to make new "good first issue's" available, and he
doesn't want to get in the way.

Eeshvardasikcm is taking a while to get a PR done because it's been 20 years
since he has written game cod in C++. He was surprised to be asked to
contribute C++. He is doubling his time commitment to Carbon Project until he
can write C++ more fluently.

### Example Manual Regression Testing Protocol

It may be beneficial to proceed with posting new GitHub issues about test
regressions and untested issues that become identified. Until automated
regression testing is completed and something new may be added to the Carbon
toolchain or infrastructure, continuing with a manual test regression
procedure may help improve communication between contributors.

The concept is that future issues like this one should be categorized as:

- New test cases need to be written for XYZ.cpp, or
- Previously successful test needs new tests and maybe fixes in XYC.cpp, or
- Test cases need to be fixed in XYZ_tests.cpp, or
- XYZ_tests.cpp is too slow. Code in XYZ.cpp should be optimized.

## 2024-2025 Carbon Project 1.0 Release 

By the time Carbon Project releases version 1.0,
a PR that closes issue 2132 needs to be approved.

### Potential Toolchain Advances are Part of this Issue 2132

Eeshvardasikcm is currently integrating LLVM into his local development
environment. He already has GoogleTest integrated. His build success
frequencies are increasing.

LLVM has some basic test regression already in their toolchain that appears to
require python. Carbon doesn't use python until the bazel build stage.
Eeshvardasikcm is not sure if GoogleTest handles regression testing.
GoogleTest definitely appears to be great for organizing tests and identifying
regressions.

## Goals

The goal is to have this issue relevant roadmap serve as a tool
that helps this issue become resolved. This issue has been
marked as long term. There are potential reoccurring problems with
this issue and relevant string-literal issues. The goal is that 
this roadmap will help to maintain regression testing and
potentially benchmarking regression testing.

## Other information

This roadmap.md file was modeled after the roadmap.md file in the
main project folder. For completion of modeling after the
whole project folder, there is other information here that is
modeled after the README.md file in the main project folder.

This is a unique roadmap that has the goal of being parallel with the main
Carbon Project Roadmap in a way that this sub-team roadmap will be managed by
Erik Douglas Ward (eeshvardasikcm) and is composed of eeshvardasikcm only.

This roadmap is designed in such a way that potential for merging this roadmap
with an encompassing Carbon Project sub-team is primary.

The timeline of this roadmap is very slow to maximize reduction of stress.

The timeline will change regularly as goals will likely be achieved well ahead
of timeline schedule.

### Groups

Erik Douglas Ward (eeshvardasikcm) is the only one contributing to this issue
number 2132 right now. It is possible that others may also contribute. This
roadmap.md file is set up in the eeshvardasikcm fork because of the nature of
this issue and also because eeshvardasikcm has project management skills.

### Contributing to Carbon:

Please check in the main project folder for all the details on how to
contribute to Carbon Project.

### Issue 2132 Sub-team Not Officially Part of the Main Carbon Project

Issue 2132 sub-team project files are not intended to be added to the main
Carbon Project docs project folders.

Referencing this 2132_subteam_roadmap branch of my fork from within PR's
submitted by this 2132 sub-team should be a sufficient way to keep the Carbon
Project leads aware of the existence of this sub-team project.

This README.md file makes no unique or significant changes are made to the
main Carbon Project README.md.
