# Issue 2132 Subteam Roadmap
This is a unique roadmap that has the goal of being parallel with the main Carbon Project Roadmap in a way that this subteam roadmap will be managed by myself, Erik Douglas Ward, and includes myself only.

This roadmap is designed in such a way that potential for merging this roadmap with an encompassing Carbon Project subteam is primary.

This timeline of this roadmap is very slow to maximize reduction of stress.

The timeline will likely change regularly as goals will likely be achieved well ahead of timeline schedule.

## 2023

By the end of 2023, a PR that intends to close issue 2023 needs to be submitted.

Closure of issue 2132 may be possible 'prematurely' if this roadmap,
is referenced to from within the PR,
and this roadmap has evolved to outline a clear path to completion of working regression testing.

The goal is that if any string literal bugs concerning line ending tabs appear after the closure of this issue,
then the regression testing system should be able to either catch the bug or be manually informed of any new bugs.

## 2024-2025 Carbon Project 1.0 Release 

By the time Carbon Project releases version 1.0,
a PR that closes issue 2132 needs to be approved.
