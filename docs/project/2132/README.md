# Issue 2132 subteam project

Issue 2132 subteam project files are not intended to be added to the main Carbon Project docs project folders.

Referencing this 2132_subteam_roadmap branch of my fork from within PR's submitted by this 2132 subteam should be a sufficient way to keep the Carbon Project leads aware of the existence of this subteam project.

No unique or significant changes are made to the main Carbon Project README.md.

Please refer to the main Carbon Project README.md file:
