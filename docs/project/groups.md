These are groups used by the Carbon Language project, listed here for central
tracking.

We use a mix of:

-   Groups to assist contacting key contributors on appropriate systems:
    -   **GitHub teams**
    -   **Discord roles**
-   **Google groups**, usually as Google Drive ACLs. We generally won't use
    these as contact lists, unless specifically mentioned. Please prefer other
    community forums.

## All contributors

-   [GitHub organization](https://github.com/orgs/carbon-language/people)
    -   [GitHub team: Contributors with label access](https://github.com/orgs/carbon-language/teams/contributors-with-label-access):
        Mirrors the GitHub organization for write access.
        [Manually updated](/github_tools/update_label_access.py).
-   [Discord access](https://discord.com/app)
-   [Google group](https://groups.google.com/g/carbon-lang-contributors): Grants
    Google Drive access.

## Team-specific access

Any team-specific access will typically be managed by a team owner or admin,
when somebody joins the respective team.

### Admins

-   [GitHub owners](https://github.com/orgs/carbon-language/people?query=role%3Aowner)
-   Discord role: admin

### Carbon leads

-   [GitHub team](https://github.com/orgs/carbon-language/teams/carbon-leads)
-   Discord role: carbon-leads

### Conduct team

For most purposes, the Core team should be contacted about conduct issues.

-   [Google group](https://groups.google.com/g/carbon-lang-conduct-team):
    Primarily a contact list.

### Implementation team

This team is responsible for development of Carbon's primary, reference
implementation and toolchain. It also oversees other related implementation work
within the Carbon project, from tooling of the language spec to test suites.
There may be some overlap with [admins](#admins) -- any issue can be resolved by
escalating to the [Carbon leads](#carbon-leads). Notably, this team is _not_
responsible for the _design_ of the language itself, only for its
implementation.
