# Carbon: Groups

These are groups used by the Carbon Language project, listed here for central tracking.

We use a mix of:

*   **GitHub teams** to assist contacting key contributor groups on GitHub.
*   **Google groups**, usually as Google Drive ACLs. We generally won't use
    these as contact lists, unless specifically mentioned. Please prefer
    Discourse Forums.
