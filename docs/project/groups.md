We use a mix of:

- Groups to assist contacting key contributors on appropriate systems:
  - **GitHub teams**
  - **Discourse Forums groups**
  - **Discord Chat roles**
- **Google groups**, usually as Google Drive ACLs. We generally won't use these
  as contact lists, unless specifically mentioned. Please prefer Discourse
  Forums.
