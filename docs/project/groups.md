# Carbon: Groups

These are groups used by the Carbon Language project, listed here for central
tracking.

We use a mix of:

- **GitHub teams** to assist contacting key contributor groups on GitHub.
- **Google groups**, usually as Google Drive ACLs. We generally won't use these
  as contact lists, unless specifically mentioned. Please prefer Discourse
  Forums.
