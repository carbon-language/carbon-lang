These are groups used by the Carbon Language project, listed here for central
tracking.

We use a mix of:

-   Groups to assist contacting key contributors on appropriate systems:
    -   **GitHub teams**
    -   **Discourse Forums groups**
    -   **Discord Chat roles**
-   **Google groups**, usually as Google Drive ACLs. We generally won't use
    these as contact lists, unless specifically mentioned. Please prefer
    Discourse Forums.
