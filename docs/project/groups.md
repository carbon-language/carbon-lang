## Overview

These are groups used by the Carbon Language project, listed here for central
tracking. Membership will typically be managed by a team owner or admin; see
each group's summary for information on how to join.

Note that some links are admin or member restricted. We're providing public
links where possible.

### Linked entities

Groups are defined by their linked entities in Carbon's various forums:

-   [GitHub teams](https://github.com/orgs/carbon-language/teams): Used
    primarily for GitHub ACLs.
    -   [GitHub organization members](https://github.com/orgs/carbon-language/people):
        This should only contain people in teams.
-   Discord roles: Used to identify team members on Discord, and for ACLs.
-   [Google groups](https://admin.google.com/ac/groups): Used for a mix of
    contact lists and ACLs.

## Carbon leads

See [governance structure](evolution.md#governance-structure) for team
information.

-   GitHub teams: [Leads](https://github.com/orgs/carbon-language/teams/leads)
-   Discord roles: lead
-   Google groups: None

## Conduct team

See [Conduct team](teams/conduct_team.md) for information.

-   GitHub teams: None
-   Discord roles: None
-   Google groups:
    [conduct@carbon-lang.dev](https://groups.google.com/a/carbon-lang.dev/g/conduct/about)
    Used as a contact list.

### Moderators

See [moderators](moderators.md) for information.

-   GitHub teams:
    [Moderators](https://github.com/orgs/carbon-language/teams/moderators)
-   Discord roles: moderator, senior-moderator
-   Google groups:
    [moderators](https://groups.google.com/a/carbon-lang.dev/g/moderators/about):
    Used for Google Drive ACLs.

## Admins

Maintains infrastructure. Membership changes are handled on an as-needed basis
by leads.

Note that while various groups exist, the way admins are actually configured
goes a little beyond this.

-   Github teams: [Admins](https://github.com/orgs/carbon-language/teams/admins)
    -   Canonically, the
        [role:owner](https://github.com/orgs/carbon-language/people?query=role%3Aowner)
        search.
-   Discord roles: admin
-   Google groups:
    [admins](https://groups.google.com/a/carbon-lang.dev/g/conduct/about): Used
    for `carbon-lang.dev` security settings.

## Implementation team

This team is responsible for development of Carbon's primary, reference
implementation and toolchain. It also oversees other related implementation work
within the Carbon project, from tooling of the language spec to test suites.
There may be some overlap with [admins](#admins) -- any issue can be resolved by
escalating to the [Carbon leads](#carbon-leads). Notably, this team is _not_
responsible for the _design_ of the language itself, only for its
implementation.

-   GitHub teams: None
-   Discord role: implementation-team
-   Google groups: None
