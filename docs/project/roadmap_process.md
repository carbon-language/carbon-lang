Carbon has an annual roadmap to align and focus the work of the teams and
community. Teams will need to defer work on Carbon that may be good and make
sense but doesn't align with the current focus and plan of the project.

The core team will draft proposed roadmaps each year, going through the standard
proposal review process. Objectives and key results will be based on
[goals](goals.md), [success criteria](principles/success_criteria.md), and
tactical features.

It is expected that the core team will provide a draft decision and enter
decision review first thing at the beginning of the year, concluding in an
accepted plan of record for the overarching direction of the project for that
year. Subteams may optionally follow a similar practice as needed for their area
of Carbon.

This roadmap is not strictly binding and does not need to cover everything that
will happen. However, it can and should be used by teams to defer some proposals
as needed to focus on proposals aligned with the current roadmap.

The roadmap is also subject to change, just as any other document, with a fresh
proposal. The core team should critically evaluate the direction and any new
information on a quarterly basis during the initial phase of the project and
adjust the roadmap as needed to stay focused on the most important things.
