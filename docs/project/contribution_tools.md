## Setup commands

These commands should help set up a development environment on your machine.

<!-- google-doc-style-ignore -->
<!-- Need to retain "repo" in "gh repo clone". -->

### Debian or Ubuntu

```
# Update apt.
sudo apt update

# Install tools.
sudo apt install \
  bazel \
  clang \
  gh \
  libc++-dev \
  lld \
  python3 \
  zlib1g-dev

# Install pre-commit.
pip3 install pre-commit

# Set up git.
# If you don't already have a fork:
gh repo fork --clone carbon-language/carbon-lang
cd carbon-lang
pre-commit install

# Run tests.
bazel test //...:all
```

> NOTE: Most LLVM 14+ installs should build Carbon. If you're having issues, see
> [troubleshooting build issues](#troubleshooting-build-issues).

### macOS

```
# Install Hombrew.
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL \
  https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"

# IMPORTANT: Make sure `brew` is added to the PATH!

# Install Homebrew tools.
brew install \
  bazelisk \
  gh \
  llvm \
  python@3.10

# IMPORTANT: Make sure `llvm` is added to the PATH! It's separate from `brew`.

# Install pre-commit.
pip3 install pre-commit

# Set up git.
gh repo fork --clone carbon-language/carbon-lang
cd carbon-lang
pre-commit install

# Run tests.
bazel test //...:all
```

> NOTE: On macOS, you should end up adding rc file lines similar to:
>
> ```
> # For `brew`, `gh`, and other tools:
> export PATH="${HOME}/.brew/bin:${PATH}"
> # For `llvm`:
> export PATH="$(brew --prefix llvm)/bin:${PATH}"
> ```

## Tools

### Main tools

These tools are essential for work on Carbon.

-   Package managers
    -   `apt` (for Debian or Ubuntu)
        -   To upgrade versions of `apt` packages, it will be necessary to
            periodically run `sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade`.
    -   [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) (for macOS)
        -   To upgrade versions of `brew` packages, it will be necessary to
            periodically run `brew upgrade`.
    -   [`python3` and `pip3`](https://python.org)
        -   Carbon requires Python 3.9 or newer.
        -   To upgrade versions of `pip3` packages, it will be necessary to
            periodically run `pip3 list --outdated`, then
            `pip3 install -U <package>` to upgrade desired packages.
        -   When upgrading, version dependencies may mean packages _should_ be
            outdated, and not be upgraded.
-   Main tools
    -   [Bazel](https://www.bazel.build/)
    -   [Bazelisk](https://docs.bazel.build/versions/master/install-bazelisk.html)
        (for macOS): Handles Bazel versions.
    -   [Clang](https://clang.llvm.org/) and [LLVM](https://llvm.org/)
        -   NOTE: Most LLVM 14+ installs should build Carbon. If you're having
            issues, see
            [troubleshooting build issues](#troubleshooting-build-issues).
    -   [gh CLI](https://github.com/cli/cli): Helps with GitHub.
    -   [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com): Validates and cleans up git
        commits.
-   Libraries
    -   zlib1g-dev: Used as a library, but not installed on all Linux systems.

#### Running pre-commit

[pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com) is typically set up using
`pre-commit install`. When set up in this mode, it will check for issues when
`git commit` is run. A typical commit workflow looks like:

1. `git commit` to try committing files. This automatically executes
   `pre-commit run`, which may fail and leave files modified for cleanup.
2. `git add .` to add the automatically modifications done by `pre-commit`.
3. `git commit` again.

You can also use `pre-commit run` to check pending changes without `git commit`,
or `pre-commit run -a` to run on all files in the repository.

> NOTE: Some developers prefer to run `pre-commit` on `git push` instead of
> `git commit` because they want to commit files as originally authored instead
> of with pre-commit modifications. To switch, run
> `pre-commit uninstall && pre-commit install -t pre-push`.

### Optional tools

These tools aren't necessary to contribute to Carbon, but can be worth
considering if they fit your workflow.

-   [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/): A UI for managing GitHub
    repositories.
-   `rs-git-fsmonitor` and Watchman: Helps make `git` run faster on large
    repositories.
    -   **WARNING**: Bugs in `rs-git-fsmonitor` and/or Watchman can result in
        `pre-commit` deleting files. If you see files being deleted, disable
        `rs-git-fsmonitor` with `git config --unset core.fsmonitor`.
-   [vim-prettier](https://github.com/prettier/vim-prettier): A vim integration
    for [Prettier](https://prettier.io/), which we use for formatting.
-   [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/): A code editor.
    -   We provide [recommended extensions](/.vscode/extensions.json) to assist
        Carbon development. Some settings changes must be made separately:
        -   Python â€º Formatting: Provider: `black`
    -   **WARNING:** Visual Studio Code modifies the `PATH` environment
        variable, particularly in the terminals it creates. The `PATH`
        difference can cause `bazel` to detect different startup options,
        discarding its build cache. As a consequence, it's recommended to use
        **either** normal terminals **or** Visual Studio Code to run `bazel`,
        not both in combination. Visual Studio Code can still be used for other
        purposes, such as editing files, without interfering with `bazel`.
    -   [DevContainers](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/containers): A
        way to use Docker for build environments.
        -   After following the
            [installation instructions](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/containers#_installation),
            you should be prompted to use Carbon's
            [devcontainer](/.devcontainer/devcontainer.json) with "Reopen in
            container".

### Manually building Clang and LLVM (not recommended)

We primarily test against [apt.llvm.org](https://apt.llvm.org) and Homebrew
installations. However, you can build and install LLVM yourself if you feel more
comfortable with it. The essential CMake options to pass in order for this to
work reliably include:

```
-DLLVM_ENABLE_PROJECTS=clang;clang-tools-extra;lld
-DLLVM_ENABLE_RUNTIMES=compiler-rt;libcxx;libcxxabi;libunwind
-DRUNTIMES_CMAKE_ARGS=-DLLVM_ENABLE_PER_TARGET_RUNTIME_DIR=OFF;-DCMAKE_POSITION_INDEPENDENT_CODE=ON;-DLIBCXX_ENABLE_STATIC_ABI_LIBRARY=ON;-DLIBCXX_STATICALLY_LINK_ABI_IN_SHARED_LIBRARY=OFF;-DLIBCXX_STATICALLY_LINK_ABI_IN_STATIC_LIBRARY=ON;-DLIBCXX_USE_COMPILER_RT=ON;-DLIBCXXABI_USE_COMPILER_RT=ON;-DLIBCXXABI_USE_LLVM_UNWINDER=ON
```

## Troubleshooting build issues

### Old LLVM versions

Many build issues result from the particular options `clang` and `llvm` have
been built with, particularly when it comes to system-installed versions. If you
run `clang --version`, you should see at least version 14. If you see an older
version, please update.

macOS only: After installing from Homebrew, you may need to open a new shell to
get `$PATH` changes.

It may be necessary to run `bazel clean` after updating versions in order to
clean up cached state.

### Asking for help

If you're having trouble resolving issues, please ask on
[#build-help](https://discord.com/channels/655572317891461132/824137170032787467),
providing the output of the following diagnostic commands:

```shell
echo $CC
which clang
clang --version
grep llvm_bindir $(bazel info workspace)/bazel-execroot/external/bazel_cc_toolchain/clang_detected_variables.bzl

# If on macOS:
brew --prefix llvm
```

These commands will help diagnose potential build issues by showing which
tooling is in use.

## Troubleshooting debug issues

Pass `-c dbg` to `bazel build` in order to compile with debugging enabled. For
example:

```shell
bazel build -c dbg //explorer
```

Then debugging works with GDB:

```shell
gdb bazel-bin/explorer/explorer
```

Note that LLVM uses DWARF v5 debug symbols, which means that GDB version 10.1 or
newer is required. If you see an error like this:

```shell
Dwarf Error: DW_FORM_strx1 found in non-DWO CU
```

It means that the version of GDB used is too old, and does not support the DWARF
v5 format.
