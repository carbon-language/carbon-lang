Carbon repositories follow a few basic principles:

-   Development directly on the `trunk` branch and
    [revert to green](#green-tests).
-   Always use pull requests, rather than pushing directly.
-   Changes should be small, incremental, and review-optimized.
-   Preserve linear history by
    [rebasing](https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/about-pull-request-merges#rebase-and-merge-your-pull-request-commits)
    or
    [squashing](https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/about-pull-request-merges#squash-and-merge-your-pull-request-commits)
    pull requests rather than using unsquashed merge commits.

These principles try to optimize for several different uses or activities with
version control:

-   Continuous integration and bisection to identify failures and revert to
    green.
-   Code review both at the time of commit and follow-up review after commit.
-   Understanding how things evolve over time, which can manifest in different
    ways:
    -   When were things introduced?
    -   How does the main branch and project evolve over time?
    -   How was a bug or surprising thing introduced?

Note that this document focuses on the mechanical workflow and branch
management. Details of the code review process are in their own
[document](code_review.md).

## Trunk based development

We work in a simple
[trunk-based development](https://trunkbaseddevelopment.com/) model. This means
all development activity takes place on a single common `trunk` branch in the
repository (our default branch). We focus on
[small, incremental changes](#small-incremental-changes) rather than feature
branches or the "scaled" variations of this workflow.

### Green tests

The `trunk` branch should always stay "green". That means that if tests fail or
if we discover bugs or errors, we revert to a "green" state by default, where
the failure or bug is no longer present. Fixing forward is fine if that will be
comparably fast and efficient. The goal isn't to dogmatically avoid fixing
forward, but to prioritize getting back to green quickly. We hope to eventually
tool this through automatic continuous-integration powered submit queues, but
even those can fail and the principle remains.

## Always use pull requests (with review) rather than pushing directly

We want to ensure that changes to Carbon are always reviewed, and the simplest
way to do this is to consistently follow a pull request workflow. Even if the
change seems trivial, still go through a pull request -- it'll likely be trivial
to review. Always wait for someone else to review your pull request rather than
just merging it, even if you have permission to do so.

Our GitHub repositories are configured to require pull requests and review
before they are merged, so this rule is enforced automatically.

## Small, incremental changes

Developing in small, incremental changes improves code review time, continuous
integration, and bisection. This means we typically squash pull requests into a
single commit when landing. We use two fundamental guides for deciding how to
split up pull requests:

1. Ensure that each pull request builds and passes any tests cleanly when you
   request review and when it lands. This will ensure bisection and continuous
   integration can effectively process them.

2. Without violating the first point, try to get each pull request to be "just
   right": not too big, not too small. You don't want to separate a pattern of
   tightly related changes into separate requests when they're easier to review
   as a set or batch, and you don't want to bundle unrelated changes together.
   Typically you should try to keep the pull request as small as you can without
   breaking apart tightly coupled changes. However, listen to your code reviewer
   if they ask to split things up or combine them.

While the default is to squash pull requests into a single commit, _during_ the
review you typically want to leave the development history undisturbed until the
end so that comments on any particular increment aren't lost. We typically use
the GitHub squash-and-merge functionality to land things.

### Stacking dependent pull requests

Carbon uses pull requests in the common, distributed GitHub model where you
first fork the repository, typically into your own private GitHub fork, and then
develop on feature branches in that fork. When a branch is ready for review, it
is turned into a pull request against the official repository. This flow should
always be where you start when contributing to Carbon, and it scales well even
with many independent changes in flight.

However, a common limitation to hit is when you want to create a _stack_ of
_dependent_, small, and incremental changes and allow them to be reviewed in
parallel. Each of these should be its own pull request to facilitate our desire
for small and incremental changes and review. Unfortunately, GitHub has very
poor support for managing the _review_ of these stacked pull requests.
Specifically, one pull request cannot serve as the _base_ for another pull
request, so each pull request will include all of the commits and diffs of the
preceding pull requests in the stack.

We suggest a specific workflow to address this (note, commit access is
required):

1.  Create your initial pull request from a branch of your fork, nothing special
    is needed at this step. Let's say you have a branch `feature-basic` in your
    clone of your fork, and that the `origin` remote is your fork.

    Push the branch to your fork:

    ```shell
    git checkout feature-basic
    git push origin
    ```

    And create a pull request for it using the
    [`gh`](/docs/project/contribution_tools.md#gh-cli) tool:

    ```shell
    gh pr create
    ```

    Let's imagine this creates a pull request `N` in the upstream repository.

2.  _If_ you end up needing to create a subsequent pull request based on the
    first one, we need to create a _branch_ in the upstream repository that
    tracks the first pull request and serves as the base for the subsequent pull
    request. Assuming your fork `$USER/carbon-lang` is remote `origin` and
    `carbon-language/carbon-lang` is remote `upstream` in your repository:

    ```shell
    git checkout feature-basic
    git push upstream HEAD:pull-N-feature-basic
    ```

    Everyone marked as a contributor to Carbon is allowed to push branches if
    the name matches `pull-*`, skipping pull request review processes. They can
    be force pushed as necessary and deleted. These branch names should only be
    used for this ephemeral purpose. All other branch names are protected.

3.  Create your stacked branch on your fork:

    ```shell
    git checkout -b next-feature-extension
    git commit -a -m 'Some initial work on the next feature.'
    git push origin
    ```

4.  Create the pull request using the upstream branch tracking your prior pull
    request as the base:

    ```shell
    gh pr create --base pull-N-feature-basic
    ```

    This creates a baseline for the new, stacked pull request that you have
    manually synced to your prior pull request.

5.  Each time you update the original pull request by pushing more commits to
    the `feature-basic` branch on your `origin`, you'll want to re-push to the
    upstream tracking branch as well:

    ```shell
    git checkout feature-basic
    git commit -a -m 'Address some code review feedback...'
    git push
    git push upstream HEAD:pull-N-feature-basic
    ```

    Then _merge_ those changes into your subsequent pull request:

    ```shell
    git checkout next-feature-extension
    git merge feature-basic
    git push
    ```

    The merge will prevent disrupting the history of `next-feature-extension`
    where you may have code review comments on specific commits, while still
    allowing the pull request diff view to show the new delta after
    incorporating the new baseline.

6.  Follow a similar process as in 5 above for merging updates from the main
    branch of `upstream`:

    ```shell
    git checkout trunk
    git pull --rebase upstream

    # Update your fork (optional).
    git push

    # Merge changes from upstream into your branch without disrupting history.
    git checkout feature-basic
    git merge trunk
    # Push to the first PR on your fork.
    git push
    # Synchronize the upstream tracking branch for the first PR.
    git push upstream HEAD:pull-N-feature-basic

    # Merge changes from the first PR (now including changes from trunk)
    # without disrupting history.
    git checkout next-feature-extension
    git merge feature-basic
    # And push to the second PR on your fork.
    git push
    ```

7.  When the first pull request lands in the main upstream branch, merge those
    changes from upstream trunk into the stacked branch:

    ```shell
    # Pick up the first PR's changes from upstream trunk.
    git checkout trunk
    git pull --rebase upstream

    # Merge those changes into the stacked PR branch.
    git checkout next-feature-extension
    git merge trunk
    git push
    ```

    Then update the stacked PR's base branch to be `carbon-language:trunk`
    rather than the upstream tracking branch. To do this, go to the page for the
    PR on GitHub, click the "Edit" button to the right of the PR title, and then
    select `trunk` from the "base" drop-down box below the PR title.

    Once that's done, delete the upstream tracking branch:

    ```shell
    git push upstream --delete pull-N-feature-basic
    ```

8.  When landing the second, stacked pull request, it will require actively
    rebasing or squashing due to the complex merge history used while updating.

Additional notes:

-   If you need to create a third or more stacked pull requests, simply repeat
    the steps starting from #2 above for each pull request in the stack, but
    starting from the prior pull request's branch.

-   If you want to split the two pull requests so they become independent, you
    can explicitly edit the base branch of a pull request in the GitHub UI. The
    result will be two pull requests with an overlapping initial sequence of
    commits. You can then restructure each one to make sense independently.

### Managing pull requests with multiple commits

Sometimes, it will make sense to _land_ a series of separate commits for a
single pull request through rebasing. This can happen when there is important
overarching context that should feed into the review, but the changes can be
usefully decomposed when landing them. When following this model, each commit
you intend to end up on the `trunk` branch needs to follow the same fundamental
rules as the pull request above: they should each build and pass tests when
landed in order, and they should have well written, cohesive commit messages.

Prior to landing the pull request, you are expected to rebase it to produce this
final commit sequence, either interactively or not. This kind of rebase rewrites
the history in Git, which can make it hard to track the resolution of code
review comments. Typically, only do this as a cleanup step when the review has
finished, or when it won't otherwise disrupt code review. It is healthy and
expected to add "addressing review comments" commits during the review and then
squashing them away before the pull request is merged.

## Linear history

We want the history of the `trunk` branch of each repository to be as simple and
easy to understand as possible. While Git has strong support for managing
complex history and merge patterns, we find understanding and reasoning about
the history -- especially for humans -- to be at least somewhat simplified by
sticking to a linear progression. As a consequence, we either squash pull
requests or rebase them when merging them.
