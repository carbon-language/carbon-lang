# Carbon: Commenting guidelines

These commenting guidelines are complementary to the
[evolution process](evolution.md). The community comments on proposals when the
proposal's status is "RFC", providing both positive and critical feedback. We
always try to keep feedback, even when critical, constructive and supportive.

## Guidelines

- **Comments should be specific about the issue.** They should include a
  suggested action, and the expected result from that action. The more specific
  a comment is, the easier it will be for the proposal author to evaluate.

  - Objections to specific phrasing should suggest alternative phrasing.

- **Use Discourse Forums for long comments.** If a Google Doc comment would be
  over two paragraphs, take it to the Discourse Forum topic. Doc comments are
  good for quick, short feedback; detailed feedback is better shared on
  Discourse Forums.

  - Use the forum topic created by the author, rather than creating a new topic.
    It needs to be easy for authors and other reviewers to find comments.
  - If your comment represents a significant change to the doc, include a list
    of pros and cons. Even if the author disagrees with the change, they can use
    those to document the alternative.

- **Be supportive in your criticism.** The author may be receiving many
  comments, and we want to keep contributors motivated to respond.

- **Be thoughtful about interactions.** Keep the
  [code of conduct](/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) in mind. Try to understand
  disagreements, and if you can't make progress, step back and think about other
  possible approaches.

- **Compliment the author when you're happy with a proposal.** Especially on the
  Discourse Forum topics where others will see the feedback. This helps all of
  us avoid _only_ focusing on how proposals should improve. We want to balance
  that important feedback with explicit and positive feedback for all the good
  aspects.

When commenting on a proposal, some questions community members might want to
address are:

- What is your evaluation of the proposal?
- Is the problem being addressed significant enough to warrant a change to
  Carbon?
- Does this proposal fit with Carbon's
  [goals, priorities, and principles](goals.md)?
- Are there alternative approaches that may be better suited to the problem?
- If you have used other languages or libraries with a similar feature, how does
  the proposal compare?
