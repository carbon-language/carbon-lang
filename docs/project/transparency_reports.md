## Overview

Carbon regularly publishes transparency reports that cover conduct issues that
have come up in our spaces as well as the moderation and other actions taken in
response. We prioritize keeping the Carbon community
[welcoming and inclusive](/docs/project/goals.md#community-and-culture) and
believe this kind of transparency is essential to sustaining that.

## Cadence and publishing

We publish a report quarterly in a GitHub discussion thread in the
[transparency reports](https://github.com/carbon-language/carbon-lang/discussions/categories/transparency-reports)
topic. We use the following template for each of these reports.

We may publish outside of the quarterly cycle if needed for an urgent response.

## Template

The Carbon community works to be welcoming and kind among itself and to others,
with a deep commitment to psychological safety, and we want to ensure that
doesnâ€™t change as we grow and evolve. To that end, we have a few ground rules
that we ask all community members to adhere to:

-   be welcoming,
-   be friendly and patient,
-   be considerate,
-   be kind,
-   be careful in the words that we choose, when we disagree, we try to
    understand why, and recognize when progress has stopped, and take a step
    back.

The following summary is intended to help the community understand what kinds of
Code of Conduct (CoC) incidents were brought to our attention lately, and how we
dealt with them.

Publishing such transparency reports in the future will help us track progress
and hold ourselves accountable to high standards of community culture.
