## Overview

Entities may have up to three declarations:

-   An optional, owning forward declaration.
    -   For example, `class MyClass;`.
    -   This must come before the definition. The API file is considered to be
        before the implementation file.
-   A required, owning definition.
    -   For example, `class MyClass { ... }`.
    -   The definition might be the _only_ declaration.
-   An optional, non-owning `extern library "<owning_library>"` declaration.
    -   For example, `extern library "OtherLibrary" class MyClass;`.
    -   It must be in a separate library from the definition.
    -   The owning library's API file must import the `extern` declaration, and
        must also contain a declaration.
    -   The owning library's declarations must have the `extern` modifier
        (without `library`).
        -   For example, `extern class MyClass;`.

For example, a library can have a forward declaration of an entity in the API
file, and use the implementation file for the entity's definition. Putting the
definition in an implementation file this way can reduce the dependencies for
API file evaluation, improving compile time. This is commonly done with
functions. For example:

```
library "MyLibrary";

fn DoSomething();
```

```
impl library "MyLibrary";

fn DoSomething {
  ...
}
```

## Matching redeclarations of an entity

In order to determine whether two redeclarations refer to the same entity, we
apply the rules:

-   Two named declarations _declare the same entity_ if they have the same scope
    and the same name.
-   One declaration _redeclares_ another if they declare the same entity and the
    second declaration appears after the first, including the case where the
    first declaration is imported. In this case, the second declaration is said
    to be a _redeclaration_ of the first.
-   Two declarations _differ_ if the sequence of tokens in the declaration
    following the introducer keyword and the optional scope, up to the semicolon
    or open brace, is different, except for `unused` modifiers on parameters.
-   The program is invalid if it contains two owning declarations of the same
    entity that differ.
    -   The non-owned `extern library` declarations will only use semantic
        matching for redeclarations, not syntactic matching.

```carbon
class A {
  fn F(n: i32);
  fn G(n: i32);
}

// ❌ Invalid: The parameter name differs.
fn A.F(m: i32) {}

// ❌ Invalid: The parameter type differs syntactically.
fn A.G(n: (i32)) {}
```

### Details

TODO: Figure out what details to pull from
[#3762](https://github.com/carbon-language/carbon-lang/pull/3763) and
[#3763](https://github.com/carbon-language/carbon-lang/pull/3763).

## `extern` and `extern library`

There are two forms of the `extern` modifier:

-   On an owning declaration, `extern` limits access to the definition.
    -   The entity must be directly imported in order to use of the definition.
    -   An `extern library` declaration is optional.
-   On a non-owning declaration, `extern library` provides a tool for breaking
    dependency cycles.
    -   The library name indicates where the entity is defined.
    -

For example, a use of both might look like:

```
library "owner";

// This `import` is required due to the `extern library`, but we also make use
// of `MyClassFactory` below. This is a circular use of `MyClass` that we
// couldn't split between libraries without `extern`.
import library "factory";

extern class MyClass {
  fn Make() -> MyClass* {
    return MyClassFactory();
  }

  var val: i32 = 0;
}
```

```
library "factory";

// Declares `MyClass` so that `MyClassFactory` can return it.
extern library "owner" class MyClass;

fn MyClassFactory(val: i32) -> MyClass*;
```

```
impl library "factory";

// Imports the definition of `MyClass`.
import library "owner";

extern fn MyClassFactory(val: i32) -> MyClass* {
  var c: MyClass* = new MyClass();
  c->val = val;
  return c;
}
```

### Effect on indirect imports

Indirect imports won't see the definition of an entity. We expect this to
primarily effect return types of functions. If an incomplete type is encountered
this way, it can be resolved by directly importing the definition. For example:

```
library "type";

// Because this is `extern`, the definition must be directly imported.
extern class MyType { var x: i32 }
```

```
library "make_type";

import library "type";

// Here we have a function which returns the type.
fn MakeMyType() -> MyType*;
```

```
library "invalid_use";

import library "make_type";

fn InvalidUse() -> i32 {
  // ❌ Invalid: `MyType` is incomplete because it's `extern` and not directly
  // imported. `x` cannot be accessed.
  return MakeMyType()->x;
}
```

```
library "valid_use";

import library "make_type";

// ✅ Valid: By directly importing the definition, we can now access `x`.
import library "type";

fn ValidUse() -> i32 {
  return MakeMyType()->x;
}
```
