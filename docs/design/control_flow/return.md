## Overview

The `return` statement ends the flow of execution within a
[function](../functions.md), returning execution to the caller. Its syntax is:

> `return` _[ expression ]_ `;`

If the function returns a value to the caller, that value is provided by an
expression in the return statement. For example:

```carbon
fn Sum(a: i32, b: i32) -> i32 {
  return a + b;
}
```

When a return type is specified, a function must _always_ `return` before
control flow can reach the end of the function body. In other words,
`fn DoNothing() -> i32 {}` would be invalid because execution will reach the end
of the function body without returning a value.

### Returning empty tuples

Returning an empty tuple `()` is special, and similar to C++'s `void` returns.
When a function has no specified return type, its return type is implicitly
`()`. `return` must not have an expression argument in this case. It also has an
implicit `return;` at the end of the function body. For example:

```carbon
// No return type is specified, so this returns `()` implicitly.
fn MaybeDraw(should_draw: bool) {
  if (!should_draw) {
    // No expression is passed to `return`.
    return;
  }
  ActuallyDraw();
  // There is an implicit `return;` here.
}
```

When `-> ()` is specified in the function signature, the return expression is
required. Omitting `-> ()` is encouraged, but specifying it is supported for
generalized code structures, including [templates](../templates.md). In order to
be consistent with other explicitly specified return types, `return;` is invalid
in this case. For example:

```carbon
// `-> ()` defines an explicit return value.
fn MaybeDraw(should_draw: bool) -> () {
  if (!should_draw) {
    // As a consequence, a return value must be passed.
    return ();
  }
  ActuallyDraw();
  // The return value must again be explicit.
  return ();
}
```

### `returned var`

[Variables](../variables.md) may be declared with a `returned` statement. Its
syntax is:

> `returned` _var statement_

When a variable is marked as `returned`, it must be the only `returned` value
in-scope.

If a `returned var` is returned, the specific syntax `return var` must be used.
Returning expressions is not allowed while a `returned var` is in scope. For
example:

```carbon
fn MakeCircle(radius: i32) -> Circle {
  returned var c: Circle;
  c.radius = radius;
  // `return c` would be invalid because `returned` is in use.
  return var;
}
```

If control flow exits the scope of a `returned` variable in any way other than
`return var`, the `returned var`'s lifetime ends as normal. When this occurs,
`return` may again be used with expressions. For example:

```carbon
fn MakePointInArea(area: Area, preferred_x: i32, preferred_y: i32) -> Point {
  if (preferred_x >= 0 && preferred_y >= 0) {
    returned var p: Point = { .x = preferred_x, .y = preferred_y };
    if (area.Contains(p)) {
      return var;
    }
    // p's lifetime ends here when `return var` is not reached.
  }

  return area.RandomPoint();
}
```

### `return` and initialization

Consider the following common initialization code:

```carbon
fn CreateMyObject() -> MyType {
  return <expression>;
}

var x: MyType = CreateMyObject();
```

The `<expression>` in the return statement of `CreateMyObject` initializes the
variable `x` here. There is no copy or similar. It is equivalent to:

```carbon
var x: MyType = <expression>;
```

This applies recursively, similar to C++'s guaranteed copy elision.

In the case where additional statements should be run between constructing the
return value and returning, the use of `returned var` allows for improved
efficiency because the `returned var` can directly use the address of `var`
declared by the caller. For example, here the `returned var vector` in
`CreateVector` uses the storage of `my_vector` for initialization, avoiding a
copy:

```carbon
fn CreateVector(x: i32, y: i32) -> Vector {
  returned var vector: Vector;
  vector.x = x;
  vector.y = y;
  return var;
}

var my_vector: Vector = CreateVector(1, 2);
```

As a consequence, `returned var` is encouraged because it makes it easier to
avoid copies.
