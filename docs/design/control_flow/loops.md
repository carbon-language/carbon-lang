## `while`

`while` statements loop for as long as the passed expression returns `True`. For
example, this prints `0`, `1`, `2`, then `Done!`:

```carbon
var Int x = 0;
while (x < 3) {
  Print(x);
  ++x;
}
Print("Done!");
```

## `for`

`for` statements support range-based looping, typically over containers. For
example, this prints all names in `names`:

```carbon
for (var String name : names) {
  Print(name);
}
```

`PrintNames()` prints each `String` in the `names` `List` in iteration order.

## `break`

The `break` statement immediately ends a `while` or `for` loop. Execution will
resume at the end of the loop's scope. For example, this processes steps until a
manual step is hit (if no manual step is hit, all steps are processed):

```carbon
for (var Step step : steps) {
  if (step.IsManual()) {
    Print("Reached manual step!");
    break;
  }
  step.Process();
}
```

## `continue`

The `continue` statement immediately goes to the next loop of a `while` or
`for`. In a `while`, execution continues with the `while` expression. For
example, this prints all non-empty lines of a file, using `continue` to skip
empty lines:

```carbon
File f = OpenFile(path);
while (!f.EOF()) {
  String line = f.ReadLine();
  if (line.IsEmpty()) {
    continue;
  }
  Print(line);
}
```
