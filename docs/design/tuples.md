## TODO

This is a skeletal design, added to support [the overview](README.md). It should
not be treated as accepted by the core team; rather, it is a placeholder until
we have more time to examine this detail. Please feel welcome to rewrite and
update as appropriate.

## Overview

The primary composite type involves simple aggregation of other types as a tuple
(called a "product type" in formal type theory):

```
fn DoubleBoth(Int: x, Int: y) -> (Int, Int) {
  return (2 * x, 2 * y);
}
```

This function returns a tuple of two integers represented by the type
`(Int, Int)`. The expression to return it uses a special tuple syntax to build a
tuple within an expression: `(<expression>, <expression>)`. This is actually the
same syntax in both cases. The return type is a tuple expression, and the first
and second elements are expressions referring to the `Int` type. The only
difference is the type of these expressions. Both are tuples, but one is a tuple
of types.

Element access uses subscript syntax:

```
fn Bar(Int: x, Int: y) -> Int {
  var (Int, Int): t = (x, y);
  return t[0] + t[1];
}
```

Tuples also support multiple indices and slicing to restructure tuple elements:

```
fn Baz(Int: x, Int: y, Int: z) -> (Int, Int) {
  var (Int, Int, Int): t1 = (x, y, z);
  var (Int, Int, Int): t2 = t1[2, 1, 0];
  return t2[0 .. 2];
}
```

This code first reverses the tuple, and then extracts a slice using a half-open
range of indices.

A tuple of a single value is special and simply collapses to the single value.

Generally, functions pattern match a single tuple value of the arguments (with
some important questions above around single-value tuples) in order to bind
their parameters. However, when _calling_ a function, we insist on using
explicit parentheses to have clear and distinct syntax that matches common
conventions in C++ as well as other programming languages around function
notation.

## Open questions

### Indices as compile-time constants

In the example `t1[2, 1, 0]`, we will likely want to restrict these indices to
compile-time constants. Without that, run-time indexing would need to suddenly
switch to a variant-style return type to handle heterogeneous tuples. This would
both be surprising and complex for little or no value.

### Multiple indices

In the exmaple `t1[2, 1, 0]`, using multiple indices in this way is a bit
questionable. If we end up wanting to support multidimensional arrays / slices
(a likely selling point for the scientific world), a sequence of indices seems a
likely desired facility there. We'd either need to find a different syntax
there, change this syntax, or cope with tuples and arrays having different
semantics for multiple indices (which seems really bad).

### Slicing ranges

The intent of `0 .. 2` is to be syntax for forming a sequence of indices based
on the half-open range [0, 2). There are a bunch of questions we'll need to
answer here:

- Is this valid anywhere? Only some places?
- What _is_ the sequence?
  - If it is a tuple of indices, maybe that solves the above issue, and unlike
    function call indexing with multiple indices is different from indexing with
    a tuple of indexes.
- Do we need syntax for a closed range (`...` perhaps, unclear if that ends up
  _aligned_ or in _conflict_ with other likely uses of `...` in pattern
  matching)?
- All of these syntaxes are also very close to `0.2`, is that similarity of
  syntax OK?
  - Do we want to require the `..` to be surrounded by whitespace to minimize
    that collision?

### Single-value tuples

This remains an area of active investigation. There are serious problems with
all approaches here. Without the collapse of one-tuples to scalars we need to
distinguish between a parenthesized expression (`(42)`) and a one tuple (in
Python or Rust, `(42,)`), and if we distinguish them then we cannot model a
function call as simply a function name followed by a tuple of arguments; one of
`f(0)` and `f(0,)` becomes a special case. With the collapse, we either break
genericity by forbidding `(42)[0]` from working, or it isn't clear what it means
to access a nested tuple's first element from a parenthesized expression:
`((1, 2))[0]`.

### Function pattern match

There are some interesting corner cases we need to expand on to fully and more
precisely talk about the exact semantic model of function calls and their
pattern match here, especially to handle variadic patterns and forwarding of
tuples as arguments. We are hoping for a purely type system answer here without
needing templates to be directly involved outside the type system as happens in
C++ variadics.
