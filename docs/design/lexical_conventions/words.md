## Overview

A _word_ is a lexical element formed from a sequence of letters or letter-like
characters, such as `fn` or `Foo` or `Int`.

The exact lexical form of words has not yet been settled. However, Carbon will
follow lexical conventions for identifiers based on
[Unicode Annex #31](https://unicode.org/reports/tr31/). TODO: Update this once
the precise rules are decided; see the
[Unicode source files](/proposals/p0142.md#characters-in-identifiers) proposal.

## Alternatives considered

-   [Character encoding: We could restrict words to ASCII.](/proposals/p0142.md#character-encoding-1)
