## Overview

The following syntaxes are supported:

-   Integer literals
    -   `12345` (decimal)
    -   `0x1FE` (hexadecimal)
    -   `0b1010` (binary)
-   Real-number literals
    -   `123.456` (digits on both sides of the `.`)
    -   `123.456e789` (optional `+` or `-` after the `e`)
    -   `0x1.2p123` (optional `+` or `-` after the `p`)
-   Digit separators (`_`) may be used, with
    [some restrictions](#digit-separators)

Note that real-number literals always contain a `.` with digits on both sides,
and integer literals never contain a `.`.

Literals are case-sensitive. Unlike in C++, literals do not have a suffix to
indicate their type.

## Details

### Integer literals

Decimal integers are written as a non-zero decimal digit followed by zero or
more additional decimal digits, or as a single `0`.

Integers in other bases are written as a `0` followed by a base specifier
character, followed by a sequence of digits in the corresponding base. The
available base specifiers and corresponding bases are:

| Base specifier | Base | Digits                   |
| -------------- | ---- | ------------------------ |
| `b`            | 2    | `0` and `1`              |
| `x`            | 16   | `0` ... `9`, `A` ... `F` |

The above table is case-sensitive. For example, `0b1` and `0x1A` are valid, and
`0B1`, `0X1A`, and `0x1a` are invalid.

A zero at the start of a literal can never be followed by another digit: either
the literal is `0`, the `0` begins a base specifier, or the next character is a
decimal point (see below). No support is provided for octal literals, and any C
or C++ octal literal (other than `0`) is invalid in Carbon.

### Real-number literals

Real numbers are written as a decimal or hexadecimal integer followed by a
period (`.`) followed by a sequence of one or more decimal or hexadecimal
digits, respectively. A digit is required on each side of the period. `0.` and
`.3` are both invalid.

A real number can be followed by an exponent character, an optional `+` or `-`
(defaulting to `+` if absent), and a character sequence matching the grammar of
a decimal integer with some value _N_. For a decimal real number, the exponent
character is `e`, and the effect is to multiply the given value by
10<sup>&plusmn;_N_</sup>. For a hexadecimal real number, the exponent character
is `p`, and the effect is to multiply the given value by
2<sup>&plusmn;_N_</sup>. The exponent suffix is optional for both decimal and
hexadecimal real numbers.

Note that a decimal integer followed by `e` is not a real-number literal. For
example, `3e10` is not a valid literal.

When a real-number literal is interpreted as a value of a real-number type, its
value is the representable real number closest to the value of the literal. In
the case of a tie, the nearest value whose mantissa is even is selected.

The decimal real number syntax allows for any decimal fraction to be expressed
-- that is, any number of the form _a_ x 10<sup>-_b_</sup>, where _a_ is an
integer and _b_ is a non-negative integer. Because the decimal fractions are
dense in the reals and the set of values of the real-number type is assumed to
be discrete, every value of the real-number type can be expressed as a real
number literal. However, for certain applications, directly expressing the
intended real-number representation may be more convenient than producing a
decimal equivalent that is known to convert to the intended value. Hexadecimal
real-number literals are provided in order to permit values of binary floating
or fixed point real-number types to be expressed directly.

### Digit separators

If digit separators (`_`) are included in literals, they must meet the
respective condition:

-   For decimal integers, the digit separators shall occur every three digits
    starting from the right. For example, `2_147_483_648`.
-   For hexadecimal integers, the digit separators shall occur every four digits
    starting from the right. For example, `0x7FFF_FFFF`.
-   For real-number literals, digit separators can appear in the decimal and
    hexadecimal integer portions (prior to the period and after the optional `e`
    or mandatory `p`) as described in the previous bullets. For example,
    `2_147.483648e12_345` or `0x1_00CA.FEF00Dp+24`
-   For binary literals, digit separators can appear between any two digits. For
    example, `0b1_000_101_11`.

## Divergence from other languages

The design provides a syntax that is deliberately close to that used both by C++
and many other languages, so it should feel familiar to developers. However, it
selects a reasonably minimal subset of the syntaxes. This minimal approach
provides benefits directly in line with the goal that Carbon code should be
[easy to read, understand, and write](/docs/project/goals.md#code-that-is-easy-to-read-understand-and-write):

-   Reduces unnecessary choices for programmers.
-   Simplifies the syntax rules of the language.
-   Improves consistency of written Carbon code.

That said, it still provides sufficient variations to address important use
cases for the goal of not leaving room for a lower level language:

-   Hexadecimal and binary integer literals.
-   Scientific notation floating point literals.
-   Hexadecimal (scientific) floating point literals.
