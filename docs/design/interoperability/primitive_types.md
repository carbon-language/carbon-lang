When reading this table, note:

- This list is not intended to be exhaustive, but should be indicative of
  mappings.
- In all cases where the C/C++ type comes in both `::T` and `std::T` forms in
  C++, both are implied by `T` in the table.
- When mapping from Carbon to C/C++ and there are multiple C/C++ type
  candidates, the first one in the list is intended to be the canonical answer.

## 32-bit/64-bit conversion APIs

When writing cross-platform, cross-language code, engineers will need to be
sensitive to what size they use in Carbon versus what size C++ would use.

We will provide conversion APIs, such as `ToCLong`, to improve portability.
Applications interested in maintaining cross-platform interoperability will need
to use these instead of relying on built-in mappings.

For example:

```carbon
package CppCompat;

$if platform == LP64
fn ToCLong(var Int64: val) -> Int64 { return val; }
$else
fn ToCLong(var Int64: val) -> Int32 { return (Int32)val; }
$endif

var Int64: myVal = Foo();
// retVal is always safe because an Int32 can always become an Int64.
var Int64: retVal = Cpp.ApiUsingLong(CppCompat.ToCLong(val));
```

### Platforms-specific sizes

The primary platform-specific sizes for C++ are:

|           | LP32        | ILP32   | LLP64       | LP64        |
| --------- | ----------- | ------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| `int`     | **`Int16`** | `Int32` | `Int32`     | `Int32`     |
| `long`    | `Int32`     | `Int32` | `Int32`     | **`Int64`** |
| `pointer` | `Int32`     | `Int32` | **`Int64`** | **`Int64`** |
| `size_t`  | `Int32`     | `Int32` | **`Int64`** | **`Int64`** |

In practice, we are most worried about differences between LP64 platforms,
including 64-bit Linux, and LLP64, particularly Windows x86_64. If Carbon will
support 32-bit CPUs, we are interested in the ILP32 model, which is adopted by
the vast majority of 32-bit platforms.

Similarly, `float` and `double` may end up being different sizes on particular
platforms.

## Alternatives

### 32-bit vs 64-bit and platform compatibility

At present, we plan to provide conversion methods that provide an
appropriately-sized Carbon type for a given C++ API.

Pros:

- Avoids introducing new interoperability-specific types into Carbon.

Cons:

- Methods introduce conversion overhead.
- Creates a layer of indirection when calling C++ APIs cross-platform.
  - Users may forget to convert, resulting in accidentally platform-specific
    code.

#### Provide variable size types

Carbon could provide compatibility types with matching sizes to the C++
implementation.

For example:

```carbon
package CppCompat;

$if platform == LP64
struct CLong { private var Bytes[8]: data; }
$else
struct CLong { private var Bytes[4]: data; }
$endif

// This line will fail to compile if, for example, Foo returns an Int64 while
// CLong is 32-bit.
var CppCompat.CLong: myVal = (CppCompat.CLong)Foo();
var CppCompat.CLong: retVal = Cpp.ApiUsingLong(val);
```

Pros:

- Reduces the amount of platform-specific code that authors need to provide.
- Variable-size types avoid conversion overhead.

Cons:

- Conversion methods are likely still necessary for code to switch between the
  Variable-size types and Carbon-recommended types.
- These types are likely to leak beyond C++ compatibility code, through support
  in APIs, leading to long-term technical debt.

#### Do nothing

Instead of providing conversion APIs, Carbon could provide nothing. This option
is likely only feasible if we assume that Carbon would never be used on 32-bit
platforms.

Pros:

- Simplifies the language.

Cons:

- Portability issues due to differences between C types across platforms. As a
  result, a given C or C++ API will be imported into Carbon differently
  depending on the selected target. Carbon code would have to be written in such
  a way as to compile in all modes.

### size_t and signed vs unsigned

At present, the plan is that `size_t` will map to the signed `Int64` type.

Pros:

- Idiomatically represent memory sizes, container lengths, etc as `Int64`.

Cons:

- Does not match `size_t` unsigned semantics.

#### Map size_t to UInt64

We could alternatively use `UInt64` for the mapping.

Pros:

- Matches C++ semantics.

Cons:

- Pushes engineers to use unsigned types when talking about lengths, risking
  errors with negative values and/or comparisons.

### char/unsigned char and byte vs character

At present, the plan is that `char`/`unsigned char` should map to `Byte`. `Byte`
is distinct because, while `Int8`/`UInt8` has arithmetic, `Byte` is intended to
not have arithmetic.

Pros:

- C/C++ use char types in some cases when dealing with memory, because there
  hasn't historically been a dedicated byte type.

Cons:

- Users may do character arithmetic on `char`.
  - Using an integer offset to get a letter. For example, `'A' + 15` as a way to
    get the value `'P'`.
  - Using `32` to capitalize. For example, `'a' + 32` as a way to get the value
    `'A'`.

#### Support + and - on Byte

We could plan on supporting basic `+` and `-` on `Byte`.

Pros:

- Keeps the `Byte` translation, which may be more appropriate for some APIs.

Cons:

- Adds arithmetic operations to the `Byte` type, which may be inappropriate for
  actual memory representation.

#### Create a Char8 type

We could add a `Char8` type, specifically limiting it to a single byte,
mirroring C++. Note this is `Char8` because we'll presumably have `Char32` for
UTF-32, and possibly `Char` to indicate a multi-byte Unicode character.

Pros:

- Mirrors the C++ semantic.
- Allows for character-specific behaviors, for example when printing values to
  stdout.

Cons:

- Prevents us from representing C++ memory operations as `Byte` without a
  specific type mapping.

#### Use Int8

We could convert `char` to `Int8`.

Pros:

- Makes all `char` types an `Int8`.

Cons:

- It's likely that we want to provide more character-like behaviors than `Int8`
  could offer.
- We probably don't want operators like `*` or `/` to provide integer arithmetic
  for a character.
