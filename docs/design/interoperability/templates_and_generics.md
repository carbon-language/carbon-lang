## C++ templates

Instantiating C++ templates with a Carbon type requires that type to be made
available to C++ code and the instantiation occurs against the C++ interface to
that Carbon type. For example:

```carbon
package Art;

import Cpp "<vector>";

// Extern the struct so that template code can see it:
$extern("Cpp") struct Shape {
  fn Draw() { ... }
}

// Then instantiate the template:
var Cpp.std.vector(Shape): shapes;
```

The key principle is that C++ templates are instantiated within C++ against a
C++-visible API for a given Carbon type.

## Using Carbon generics/templates with C++ types in Carbon code

Any C++ type can be used as a type parameter in Carbon. However, it will be
interpreted as Carbon code; for example, if there are any requirements for
Carbon interfaces,
[bridge code will be required](user_defined_types.md#implementing-carbon-interfaces-in-c).

## Using Carbon templates from C++

Carbon templates should be usable from C++.

For Carbon's reference toolchain, we plan to modify Clang to allow for
extensions that will use Carbon to compile the template then insert the results
into Clang's AST for expansion.

This assumes low-level modifications to LLVM. Other toolchains trying to compile
Carbon would need similar features.

## Using Carbon generics from C++

Carbon generics will require bridge code that hides the generic. This bridge
code may be written using a Carbon template, changing compatibility constraints
to match.

For example, given the Carbon code:

```carbon
fn GenericAPI[Foo:$ T](T*: x) { ... }

fn TemplateAPI[Foo:$$ T](T* x) { GenericAPI(x); }
```

We could have C++ code that uses the template wrapper to use the generic:

```cc
CppType y;
::Carbon::TemplateAPI(&y);
```

## Open questions

### Auto-generate templates to use generics

It may be possible to auto-generate appropriate templates for C++ code to use
generics. This requires further investigation.

## Alternatives

### Require bridge code

Instead of using Clang extensions to support Carbon templates, we could require
bridge code that explicitly instantiates versions of the template for use with
C++ types.

Pros:

- Avoids modifications to Clang.

Cons:

- Requires extra code to use templates from C++, making it harder to migrate
  code to Carbon.

### Translate C++ template code to Carbon

Instead of requiring Carbon types be externed for use with C++ templates, we
could instead translate the implementation of a C++ template to Carbon, then
compile it as normal.

This would rely on translation support being written for C/C++, and additionally
that it support translating partial files.

Pros:

- Builds on existing plans to build a translation tool, creating more consistent
  behavior.

Cons:

- Makes the translation tool a compilation dependency.
  - Creates new feature requirements for the translation tool.
- Limits compatibility to what the translation tool supports.
  - C++ templates may be particularly likely to use edge-case language features.
  - Translation errors may be difficult to catch.

The use of
$extern should be low cost, and the risks of relying on the
translation tool could be high, and so we expect to use $extern.
It will always be possible for a project to run the translation tool themselves
if it is preferred by a code owner.
