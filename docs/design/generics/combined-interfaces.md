## What is this?

This document is a **deep dive**: a detailed exploration of one possible model
for part of the Carbon language, and its consequences. It is not intended to
present any questions or choices, but instead to flesh out one set of possible
design details for a design option so as to make it easier to conceptualize and
analyze.

This document presents a hypothetical world: details discussed here, while
presented as facts, are all only elements of that world and do not constitute
decisions about Carbon.

## Overview

Imagine we want to write a function parameterized by a type argument. Maybe our
function is `PrintToStdout` and let's say we want to operate on values that have
a type for which we have an implementation of the `ConvertibleToString`
interface. The `ConvertibleToString` interface has a `ToString` method returning
a string. To do this, we give the `PrintToStdout` function two parameters: one
is the value to print, let's call that `val`, the other is the type of that
value, let's call that `T`. The type of `val` is `T`, what is the type of `T`?
Well, since we want to let `T` be any type implementing the
`ConvertibleToString` interface, we express that in the "interfaces are
type-types" model by saying the type of `T` is `ConvertibleToString`.

Since we can figure out `T` from the type of `val`, we don't need the caller to
pass in `T` explicitly, it can be an
[implicit argument](https://github.com/josh11b/carbon-lang/blob/generics-docs/docs/design/generics/terminology.md#implicit-argument)
(also see
[implicit argument](https://github.com/josh11b/carbon-lang/blob/generics-docs/docs/design/generics/overview.md#implicit-arguments)
in the Generics overview doc). Basically, the user passes in a value for `val`,
and the type of `val` determines `T`. `T` still gets passed into the function
though, and it plays an important role -- it defines the implementation of the
interface. We can think of the interface as defining a struct type whose members
are function pointers, and an implementation of an interface as a value of that
struct with actual function pointer values. So an implementation is a table of
function pointers (one per function defined in the interface) that gets passed
into a function as the type argument. For more on this, see
[the model section](#model) below.

In addition to function pointer members, interfaces can include any constants
that belong to a type. For example, the
[type's size](#sized-types-and-type-types) (represented by an integer constant
member of the type) is an optional member of an interface and its
implementation. There are a few cases why we would include another interface
implementation as a member:

-   [associated types](#associated-types)
-   [type parameters](#parameterized-interfaces)
-   [interface requirements](#interface-requiring-other-interfaces)

The function can decide whether that type argument is passed in
[statically](https://github.com/josh11b/carbon-lang/blob/generics-docs/docs/design/generics/terminology.md#static-dispatch-witness-table)
(basically generating a separate function body for every different type passed
in) by using the "generic argument" syntax (`:$`, see
[the generics section](#generics) below) or
[dynamically](https://github.com/josh11b/carbon-lang/blob/generics-docs/docs/design/generics/terminology.md#dynamic-dispatch-witness-table)
using the regular argument syntax (just a colon, `:`, see
[the runtime type parameters section](#runtime-type-parameters) below). Either
way, the interface contains enough information to
[type/definition check](https://github.com/josh11b/carbon-lang/blob/generics-docs/docs/design/generics/terminology.md#complete-definition-checking)
the function body -- you can only call functions defined in the interface in the
function body. Contrast this with making the type a template argument, where you
could just use `Type` instead of an interface and it will work as long as the
function is only called with types that allow the definition of the function to
compile. You are still allowed to declare templated type arguments as having an
interface type, and this will add a requirement that the type satisfy the
interface independent of whether that is needed to compile the function body,
but it is strictly optional (you might do this to get clearer error messages,
document expectations, or express that a type has certain semantics beyond what
is captured in its member function names and signatures).

The last piece of the puzzle is how the caller of the function can produce a
value with the right type. Let's say the user has a value of type `Widget`, and
of course widgets have all sorts of functionality. If we want a `Widget` to be
printed using the `PrintToStdout` function, it needs to implement the
`ConvertibleToString` interface. Note that we _don't_ say that `Widget` is of
type `ConvertibleToString` but instead that it has a "facet type". This means
there is another type, called `Widget as ConvertibleToString`, with the
following properties:

-   `Widget as ConvertibleToString` has the same _data representation_ as
    `Widget`.
-   `Widget as ConvertibleToString` is an implementation of the interface
    `ConvertibleToString`. The functions of `Widget as ConvertibleToString` are
    just implementations of the names and signatures defined in the
    `ConvertibleToString` interface, like `ToString`, and not the functions
    defined on `Widget` values.
-   Carbon will implicitly cast values from type `Widget` to type
    `Widget as ConvertibleToString` when calling a function that can only accept
    types of type `ConvertibleToString`.
-   Typically, `Widget` would also have definitions for the methods of
    `ConvertibleToString`, such as `ToString`, unless the implementation of
    `ConvertibleToString` for `Widget` was defined as `external`.
-   You may access the `ToString` function for a `Widget` value `w` by writing a
    _qualified_ function call, like `w.(ConvertibleToString.ToString)()`. This
    qualified syntax is available whether or not the implementation is defined
    as `external`.
-   If other interfaces are implemented for `Widget`, they are also implemented
    for `Widget as ConvertibleToString` as well. The only thing that changes
    when casting a `Widget` `w` to `Widget as ConvertibleToString` are the names
    that are accessible without using the qualification syntax.

We define these facet types (alternatively, interface implementations) either
with the type, with the interface, or somewhere else where Carbon can be
guaranteed to see when needed. For more on this, see
[the implementing interfaces section](#implementing-interfaces) below.

If `Widget` doesn't implement an interface or we would like to use a different
implementation of that interface, we can define another type that also has the
same data representation as `Widget` that has whatever different interface
implementations we want. However, Carbon won't implicitly cast to that other
type, the user will have to explicitly cast to that type in order to select
those alternate implementations. For more on this, see
[the adapting type section](#adapting-types) below.

## Interfaces

An interface defines an API that a given type can implement. For example, an
interface capturing a vector API might have two methods:

```
interface Vector {
  // Here "Self" means "the type implementing this interface".
  method (Self: a) Add(Self: b) -> Self;
  method (Self: a) Scale(Double: v) -> Self;
}
```

The syntax here is intended to match how the same members would be defined in a
type. Each declaration in the interface defines an _associated item_. In this
example, `Vector` has two associated methods, `Add` and `Scale`.

An interface defines a type-type, that is a type whose values are types. The
values of an interface are specifically
[facet types](https://github.com/josh11b/carbon-lang/blob/generics-docs/docs/design/generics/terminology.md#invoking-interface-methods),
by which we mean types that are declared as specifically implementing
**exactly** this interface, and which provide definitions for all the functions
(and other members) declared in the interface.

## Implementing interfaces

Given a type, it can define an "impl" that defines how that interface is
implemented for that type. Every associated item is given a definition.
Different types satisfying `Vector` can have different definitions for `Add` and
`Scale`, so we say their definitions are associated with what type is
implementing `Vector`. The impl defines what is associated with the type for
that interface.

Impls may be defined inline inside the type definition:

```
struct Point {
  var Double: x;
  var Double: y;
  impl Vector {
    // In this scope, "Self" is an alias for "Point".
    method (Self: a) Add(Self: b) -> Self {
      return Point(.x = a.x + b.x, .y = a.y + b.y);
    }
    method (Self: a) Scale(Double: v) -> Self {
      return Point(.x = a.x * v, .y = a.y * v);
    }
  }
}
```

Interfaces that are implemented inline contribute to the type's API:

```
var Point: p1 = (.x = 1.0, .y = 2.0);
var Point: p2 = (.x = 2.0, .y = 4.0);
Assert(p1.Scale(2.0) == p2);
Assert(p1.Add(p1) == p2);
```

### Facet type

The impl definition defines a
[facet type](https://github.com/josh11b/carbon-lang/blob/generics-docs/docs/design/generics/terminology.md#invoking-interface-methods):
`Point as Vector`. While the API of `Point` includes the two fields `x` and `y`
along with the `Add` and `Scale` methods, the API of `Point as Vector` _only_
has the `Add` and `Scale` methods of the `Vector` interface. The facet type
`Point as Vector` is
[compatible](https://github.com/josh11b/carbon-lang/blob/generics-docs/docs/design/generics/terminology.md#compatible-types)
with `Point`, meaning their data representations are the same, so we allow you
to cast between the two freely:

```
var Point: a = (.x = 1.0, .y = 2.0);
// `a` has `Add` and `Scale` methods:
a.Add(a.Scale(2.0));

// Cast from Point implicitly
var Point as Vector: b = a;
// `b` has `Add` and `Scale` methods:
b.Add(b.Scale(2.0));

// Will also implicitly cast when calling functions:
fn F(Point as Vector: c, Point: d) {
  d.Add(c.Scale(2.0));
}
F(a, b);

// Explicit casts
var Point as Vector: z = (a as (Point as Vector)).Scale(3.0);
z.Add(b);
var Point: w = z as Point;
```

These casts change which names are exposed in the type's API, but as much as
possible we don't want the meaning of any given name to change. Instead we want
these casts to simply change the subset of names that are visible.

**Note:** In general the above is written assuming that casts are written
"`a as T`" where `a` is a value and `T` is the type to cast to. When we write
`Point as Vector`, the value `Point` is a type, and `Vector` is a type of a
type, or a "type-type".

**Note:** A type may implement any number of different interfaces, but may
provide at most one implementation of any single interface. This makes the act
of selecting an implementation of an interface for a type unambiguous throughout
the whole program, so e.g. `Point as Vector` is well defined.

We don't expect users to ordinarily name facet types explicitly in source code.
Instead, values are cast to a facet type as part of calling a generic function,
as described in the [Generics](#generics) section.

### External impl

Interfaces may also be implemented for a type externally, by using the `extend`
construct which takes the name of an existing type:

```
struct Point2 {
  var Double: x;
  var Double: y;
}

extend Point2 {
  impl Vector {
    // In this scope, "Self" is an alias for "Point2".
    method (Self: a) Add(Self: b) -> Self {
      return Point2(.x = a.x + b.x, .y = a.y + b.y);
    }
    method (Self: a) Scale(Double: v) -> Self {
      return Point2(.x = a.x * v, .y = a.y * v);
    }
  }
}
```

The `extend` statement is allowed to be defined in a different library from
`Point2`, restricted by
[the coherence/orphan rules](#impl-lookup-and-specialization) that ensure that
the implementation of an interface won't change based on imports. In particular,
the `extend` statement is allowed in the library defining the interface
(`Vector` in this case) in addition to the library that defines the type
(`Point2` here). This (at least partially) addresses
[the expression problem](https://eli.thegreenplace.net/2016/the-expression-problem-and-its-solutions).

We don't want the API of `Point2` to change based on what is imported though. So
the `extend` statement does not add the interface's methods to the type. It
would be particularly bad if two different libraries implemented interfaces with
conflicting names both affected the API of a single type. The result is you can
find all the names of direct (unqualified) members of a type in the definition
of that type. The only thing that may be in another library is an `impl` of an
interface.

On the other hand, if we cast to the facet type, those methods do become
visible:

```
var Point2: a = (.x = 1.0, .y = 2.0);
// `a` does *not* have `Add` and `Scale` methods:
// Error: a.Add(a.Scale(2.0));

// Cast from Point2 implicitly
var Point2 as Vector: b = a;
// `b` does have `Add` and `Scale` methods:
b.Add(b.Scale(2.0));

fn F(Point2 as Vector: c) {
  // Can call `Add` and `Scale` on `c` even though we can't on `a`.
  c.Add(c.Scale(2.0));
}
F(a);
```

You might intentionally use `extend` to implement an interface for a type to
avoid cluttering the API of that type, for example to avoid a name collision. A
syntax for reusing method implementations allows us to do this selectively when
needed:

```
struct Point3 {
  var Double: x;
  var Double: y;
  method (Self: a) Add(Self: b) -> Self {
    return Point3(.x = a.x + b.x, .y = a.y + b.y);
  }
}

extend Point3 {
  impl Vector {
    alias Add = Point3.Add;  // Syntax TBD
    method (Self: a) Scale(Double: v) -> Self {
      return Point3(.x = a.x * v, .y = a.y * v);
    }
  }
}
```

With this definition, `Point3` includes `Add` in its API but not `Scale`, while
`Point3 as Vector` includes both. This maintains the property that you can
determine the API of a type by looking at its definition.

**Rejected alternative:** We could allow types to have different APIs in
different files based on explicit configuration in that file. For example, we
could support a declaration that a given interface or a given method of an
interface is "in scope" for a particular type in this file. With that
declaration, the method could be called unqualified. This avoids most concerns
arising from name collisions between interfaces. It has a few downsides though:

-   It increases variability between files, since the same type will have
    different APIs depending on these declarations. This makes it harder to
    copy-paste code between files.
-   It makes reading code harder, since you have to search the file for these
    declarations that affect name lookup.

**Comparison with other languages:** Both Rust and Swift support external
implementation. The concept of doing this as an "extension" of the original type
is more similar to
[Swift](https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/LanguageGuide/Protocols.html#ID277),
but, unlike Swift, we don't allow a type's API to be modified outside its
definition. In Rust, all implementations are external as in
[this example](https://doc.rust-lang.org/rust-by-example/trait.html).

### Rejected: out-of-line impl

We considered an out-of-line syntax for declaring and defining interface `impl`
blocks, to replace both the inline syntax and the `extend` statement. For,
example:

```
struct Point { ... }
impl Vector for Point { ... }
```

The main advantage of this syntax was that it was uniform across many cases,
including [conditional conformance](#conditional-conformance). It wasn't ideal
across a number of dimensions though:

-   it was redundant and verbose,
-   it was difficult to read and author, and
-   it could affect the API of the type outside of the type definition.

### Qualified member names

Given a value of type `Point2` and an interface `Vector` implemented for that
type, you can access the methods from that interface using the member's
_qualified name_, whether or not the implementation is done externally with an
`extend` statement:

```
var Point2: p1 = (.x = 1.0, .y = 2.0);
var Point2: p2 = (.x = 2.0, .y = 4.0);
Assert(p1.(Vector.Scale)(2.0) == p2);
Assert(p1.(Vector.Add)(p1) == p2);
```

Note that the name in the parens is looked up in the containing scope, not in
the names of members of `Point2`. So if there was another interface
`MyInterface` with method `MyMember` defined in the `MyPackage` package also
implemented for `Point2`, you could access `MyMember` with a qualified name:

```
import MyPackage;

struct Point2 {
  ...
  impl MyPackage.MyInterface { ... }
}

var Point2: p = (.x = 1.0, .y = 2.0);
p.(MyPackage.MyInterface.MyMember)();
```

**Comparison with other languages:** This is intended to be analogous to, in
C++, adding `ClassName::` in front of a member name to disambiguate, such as
[names defined in both a parent and child class](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/357307/how-to-call-a-parent-class-function-from-derived-class-function).

## Generics

Now let us write a function that can accept values of any type that has
implemented the `Vector` interface:

```
fn AddAndScaleGeneric[Vector:$ T](T: a, T: b, Double: s) -> T {
  return a.Add(b).Scale(s);
}
var Point: v = AddAndScaleGeneric(a, w, 2.5);
```

Here `T` is a type whose type is `Vector`. The `:$` syntax means that `T` is a
_[generic argument](https://github.com/josh11b/carbon-lang/blob/generics-docs/docs/design/generics/terminology.md#generic-vs-template-arguments)_,
that is it must be known to the caller but we will only use the information
present in the signature of the function to typecheck the body of
`AddAndScaleGeneric`'s definition. In this case, we know that any value of type
`T` implements the `Vector` interface and so has an `Add` and a `Scale` method.

When we call `AddAndScaleGeneric`, we need to determine the value of `T` to use
when passed values with type `Point`. Since `T` has type `Vector`, the compiler
simply sets `T` to `Point as Vector`. This cast erases all of the API of `Point`
and substitutes the api of `Vector`, without changing anything about the data
representation. It acts like we called this non-generic function, found by
setting `T` to `Point as Vector`:

```
fn AddAndScaleForPointAsVector(
      Point as Vector: a, Point as Vector: b, Double: s)
      -> Point as Vector {
  return a.Add(b).Scale(s);
}
// May still be called with Point arguments, due to implicit casts.
// Similarly the return value can be implicitly cast to a Point.
var Point: v2 = AddAndScaleForPointAsVector(a, w, 2.5);
```

Since `Point` implements `Vector` inline, `Point` also has definitions for `Add`
and `Scale`:

```
fn AddAndScaleForPoint(Point: a, Point: b, Double: s) -> Point {
  return a.Add(b).Scale(s);
}

AddAndScaleForPoint(a, w, 2.5);
```

However, for another type implementing `Vector` but out-of-line using an
`extend` statement, such as `Point2`, the situation is different:

```
fn AddAndScaleForPoint2(Point2: a, Point2: b, Double: s) -> Point2 {
  // ERROR: `Point2` doesn't have `Add` or `Scale` methods.
  return a.Add(b).Scale(s);
}
```

Even though `Point2` doesn't have `Add` and `Scale` methods, it still implements
`Vector` and so can still call `AddAndScaleGeneric`:

```
var Point2: a2 = (.x = 1.0, .y = 2.0);
var Point2: w2 = (.x = 3.0, .y = 4.0);
var Point2: v3 = AddAndScaleGeneric(a, w, 2.5);
```

### Model

The underlying model here is
[interfaces are type-types](https://github.com/josh11b/carbon-lang/blob/generics-docs/docs/design/generics/terminology.md#interfaces-are-type-types),
in particular
[facet type-types](https://github.com/josh11b/carbon-lang/blob/generics-docs/docs/design/generics/terminology.md#facet-type-types):

-   [Interfaces](#interfaces) are types of
    [witness table](https://github.com/josh11b/carbon-lang/blob/generics-docs/docs/design/generics/terminology.md#witness-tables-eg-swift-and-carbon-generics)s
-   Facet types (defined by [Impls](#implementing-interfaces)) are
    [witness table](https://github.com/josh11b/carbon-lang/blob/generics-docs/docs/design/generics/terminology.md#witness-tables-eg-swift-and-carbon-generics)
    values
-   The compiler rewrites functions with an implicit type argument
    (`fn Foo[InterfaceName:$ T](...)`) to have an actual argument with type
    determined by the interface, and supplied at the callsite using a value
    determined by the impl.

Context:
[Carbon: types as function tables, interfaces as type-types (TODO)](#broken-links-footnote)<!-- T:Carbon: types as function tables, interfaces as type-types -->

For the example above, [the Vector interface](#interfaces) could be thought of
defining a witness table type like:

```
struct Vector {
  var Type:$ Self;  // Self is the representation type.
  // Self is a member, not a parameter, so there is a single witness table type
  // across different `Self` types.
  var fnty(Self: a, Self: b) -> Self : Add;
  var fnty(Self: a, Double: v) -> Self : Scale;
}
```

The [impl of Vector for Point](#implementing-interfaces) would be a value of
this type:

```
var Vector : VectorForPoint = (
    .Self = Point,
    .Add = fnty(Point: a, Point: b) -> Point {
      return Point(.x = a.x + b.x, .y = a.y + b.y);
    },
    .Scale = fnty(Point: a, Double: v) -> Point {
      return Point(.x = a.x * v, .y = a.y * v);
    },
);
```

Finally we can define a generic function and call it, like
<code>[AddAndScaleGeneric from the "Generics" section above](#generics)</code>
by making the witness table a regular argument to the function:

```
fn AddAndScaleGeneric[Type:$ T]
    (T: a, T: b, Double: s, Ptr(Vector(T)):$ impl) -> T {
  return impl->Scale(impl->Add(a, b), s);
}
// Point implements Vector.
var Point: v = AddAndScaleGeneric(a, w, 2.5, &VectorForPoint);
```

The rule is that generic arguments (declared using `:$`) are passed at compile
time, so the actual value of the `impl` argument here can be used to generate
the code for `AddAndScaleGeneric`. So `AddAndScaleGeneric` is using a
[static-dispatch witness table](https://github.com/josh11b/carbon-lang/blob/generics-docs/docs/design/generics/terminology.md#static-dispatch-witness-table).

## Interfaces recap

Interfaces have a name and a definition.

The definition of an interface consists of a set of declarations. Each
declaration defines a requirement for `impl` that is in turn a capability that
users can rely on. Typically those declarations also have a name, useful for
both satisfying the requirement and accessing the capability.

Interfaces are "nominal" which means their name is significant. So two
interfaces with the same definition but different names are different, just like
two structs with the same definition but different names are considered
different types. For example, lets say we define another interface, say
`LegoFish`, with the same `Add` and `Scale` method signatures. Implementing
`Vector` would not imply an implementation of `LegoFish` and vice versa.

An interface's name may be used in a few different contexts:

-   to define [an `impl` for a type](#implementing-interfaces),
-   as a namespace name in [a qualified name](#qualified-member-names), and
-   as a type-type for [a generic type parameter](#generics).

While interfaces are examples of type-types, type-types are a more general
concept, for which interfaces are a building block.

## Type-types and facet types

A type-type consists of a set of requirements and a set of names. Requirements
are typically a set of interfaces that a type must satisfy. The names are
aliases for qualified names in those interfaces.

An interface is one particularly simple example of a type-type. For example,
`Vector` as a type-type has a set of requirements consisting of the single
interface `Vector`. Its set of names consists of `Add` and `Scale` which are
aliases for the corresponding qualified names inside `Vector` as a namespace.

The requirements determine which types may be cast to a given type-type. The
result of casting a type `T` to a type-type `I` (written `T as I`) is called a
facet type, you might say a facet type `F` is the `I` facet of `T` if `F` is
`T as I`. The API of `F` is determined by the set of names in the type-type.

This general structure of type-types holds not just for interfaces, but others
described in the rest of this document.

## Structural interfaces

If the nominal interfaces discussed above are the building blocks for
type-types, structural interfaces describe how they may be composed together.
Unlike nominal interfaces, the name of a structural interface is not a part of
its value. Two different structural interfaces with the same definition are
equivalent even if they have different names. This is because types don't
explicitly specify which structural interfaces they implement, types
automatically implement any structural interfaces they can satisfy.

A structural interface definition can contain interface requirements using
`impl` declarations and names using `alias` declarations. Note that this allows
us to declare the aspects of a type-type directly.

```
structural interface VectorLegoFish {
  // Interface implementation requirements
  impl Vector;
  impl LegoFish;
  // Names
  alias Scale = Vector.Scale;
  alias VAdd = Vector.Add;
  alias LFAdd = LegoFish.Add;
}
```

We don't expect users do directly define many structural interfaces, but other
constructs we do expect them to use will be defined in terms of them. For
example, we can define the Carbon builtin `Type` as:

```
structural interface Type { }
```

That is, `Type` is the type-type with no requirements (so matches every type),
and defines no names.

```
fn F[Type:$ T](T: x) -> T {
  // Can accept values of any type. But, since we no nothing about the
  // type, we don't know about any operations on `x` inside this function.
  return x;
}

var Int: i = F(3);
var String: s = F("string");
```

### Subsumption

Given a generic type `T` with type-type `I1`, it may be implicitly cast to a
type-type `I2`, resulting in `T as I2`, as long as the requirements of `I1` are
a superset of the requirements of `I2`. Further, given a value `x` of type `T`,
it can be implicitly cast to `T as I2`. For example:

```
interface A { method (Self: this) AMethod(); }
interface B { method (Self: this) BMethod(); }
structural interface I1 {
  impl A;
  impl B;
}
structural interface I2 {
  impl A;
}
fn F2[I2:$ T2](T2: x2) {
  x2.(A.AMethod)();
}
fn F1[I1:$ T1](T1: x1) {
  x1.(A.AMethod)();
  x1.(B.BMethod)();
  // Calls `F2` with `T2 == T1 as I2` and `x2 == x1 as T2`.
  F2(x1);
}
```

### Future work: method constraints

Structural interfaces are a reasonable mechanism for describing other structural
type constraints, which we will likely want for template constraints. For
example, a method definition in a structural interface would match any type that
has a method with that name and signature. We could similarly support associated
constant and data field constraints. This is future work though, as it does not
directly impact generics in Carbon.

## Combining interfaces by adding type-types

In order to support functions that require more than one interface to be
implemented, we provide an addition operator on type-types. This operator gives
the type-type with the union of all the requirements and the union of the names
minus any conflicts.

```
interface A { method (Self: this) AMethod(); }
interface B { method (Self: this) BMethod(); }
// `A + B` is syntactic sugar for this type-type:
structural interface {
  impl A;
  impl B;
  alias AMethod = A.AMethod;
  alias BMethod = B.BMethod;
}

fn F[A + B:$ T](T: x) {
  // Can use methods of `A` or `B` on `x` here.
  x.AMethod();  // Same as `x.(A.AMethod)();`.
  x.BMethod();  // Same as `x.(B.BMethod)();`.
}

struct S {
  impl A { method (Self: this) AMethod() { Carbon.Print("A"); } }
  impl B { method (Self: this) BMethod() { Carbon.Print("B"); } }
}

var S: s = ();
F(s);
```

Any conflicting names between the two types are replaced with a name that is an
error to use.

```
interface C {
  method (Self: this) One();
  method (Self: this) Two();
}
interface D {
  method (Self: this) Two();
  method (Self: this) Three();
}
// `C + D` is syntactic sugar for this type-type:
structural interface {
  impl C;
  impl D;
  alias One = C.One;
  forbidden Two "Ambiguous, use either `(C.Two)` or `(D.Two)`.";
  alias Three = D.Three;
}
```

Conflicts can be resolved at the call site using
[the qualified name syntax](#qualified-member-names), or by defining a
structural interface explicitly and renaming the methods:

```
structural interface CAndD {
  impl C;
  impl D;
  alias One = C.One;
  alias CTwo = C.Two;
  alias DTwo = D.Two;
  alias Three = D.Three;
}

fn F[CAndD:$ T](T: x) {
  x.CTwo();
  x.DTwo();
}
```

Reserving the name when there is a conflict is part of resolving what happens
when you add more than two type-types. If `x` is forbidden in `A`, it is
forbidden in `A + B`, whether or not `B` defines the name `x`. This makes `+`
associative and commutative, and so it is well defined on sets of interfaces, or
other type-types, independent of order.

Note that we do _not_ consider two type-types using the same name to mean the
same thing to be a conflict. For example, the adding a type-type to itself gives
itself, `MyTypeType + MyTypeType == MyTypeType`. Also, given two
[interface extensions](#interface-extension) of a common base interface, the sum
should not conflict on any names in the common base.

**Open syntax question:** Instead of using `+` as the combining operator, we
could use `&`. I'm using `+` in this proposal since it is
[consistent with Rust](https://rust-lang.github.io/rfcs/0087-trait-bounds-with-plus.html).

**Alternatives considered:** See
[Carbon: Access to interface methods](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1u_i_s31OMI_apPur7WmVxcYq6MUXsG3oCiKwH893GRI/edit?usp=sharing&resourcekey=0-0lzSNebBMtUBi4lStL825g).

**Comparison with other languages:** This `+` operation on interfaces works very
similarly to Rust, with the main difference being how you
[qualify names when there is a conflict](https://doc.rust-lang.org/rust-by-example/trait/disambiguating.html).

## Interface requiring other interfaces

Some interfaces will depend on other interfaces being implemented for the same
type. For example, in C++,
[the `Container` concept](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/named_req/Container#Other_requirements)
requires all containers to also satisfy the requirements of
`DefaultConstructible`, `CopyConstructible`, `EqualityComparable`, and
`Swappable`. This is already a capability for
[type-types in general](#type-types-and-facet-types). For consistency we will
use the same semantics and syntax as we do for
[structural interfaces](#structural-interfaces):

```
interface B { method (Self: this) BMethod(); }

interface A {
  method (Self: this) AMethod();
  impl B;
}

def F[A:$ T](T: x) {
  // `x` has type `T` that implements `A`, and so has `AMethod`.
  x.AMethod();
  // `A` requires an implementation of `B`, so `T` also implements `B`.
  x.(B.BMethod)();
}

struct S {
  impl A { method (Self: this) AMethod() { ... } }
  impl B { method (Self: this) BMethod() { ... } }
}
var S: x;
F(x);
```

Like with structural interfaces, an interface implementation requirement doesn't
by itself add any names to the interface, but again those can be added with
`alias` declarations:

```
interface D {
  method (Self: this) DMethod();
  impl B;
  alias BMethod = B.BMethod;
}

def G[D:$ T](T: x) {
  // Now both `DMethod` and `BMethod` are available directly:
  x.DMethod();
  x.BMethod();
}
```

**Comparison with other languages:**
[This feature is called "Supertraits" in Rust](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch19-03-advanced-traits.html#using-supertraits-to-require-one-traits-functionality-within-another-trait).

### Interface extension

When implementing an interface, we should allow implementing the aliased names
as well. In the case of `D` above, this includes all the members of `B`,
obviating the need to implement `B` itself:

```
struct T {
  impl D {
    method (Self: this) DMethod() { ... }
    method (Self: this) BMethod() { ... }
  }
}
var T: y;
G(y);
```

This allows us to say that `D`
["extends" or "refines"](https://github.com/josh11b/carbon-lang/blob/generics-docs/docs/design/generics/terminology.md#extendingrefining-an-interface)
`B`, with some benefits:

-   This allows `B` to be an implementation detail of `D`.
-   This allows types implementing `D` to implement all of its API in one place.
-   This reduces the boilerplate for types implementing `D`.

We expect this concept to be common enough to warrant dedicated syntax:

```
interface B { method (Self: this) BMethod(); }

interface D {
  extends B;
  method (Self: this) DMethod();
}
// is equivalent to the definition of D from before:
// interface D {
//   impl B;
//   alias BMethod = B.BMethod;
//   method (Self: this) DMethod();
// }
```

No names in `D` are allowed to conflict with names in `B` (unless those names
are marked as `upcoming` or `deprecated` as noted in separate forthcoming
interface evolution doc). Hopefully this won't be a problem in practice, since
interface extension is a very closely coupled relationship, but this may be
something we will have to revisit in the future.

**Concern:** Having both `extends` and [`extend`](#external-impl) with different
meanings is going to be confusing. One should be renamed.

TODO Use cases:
[Boost.Graph](https://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_74_0/libs/graph/doc/) concepts,
see , C++ iterator concepts. See
[Carbon generics use case: graph library](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xk0GLtpBl2OOnf3F_6Z-A3DtTt-r7wdOZ5wPipYUSO0/edit?usp=sharing&resourcekey=0-mBSmwn6b6jwbLaQw2WG6OA).

To write an interface extending multiple interfaces, use multiple `extends`
declarations:

```
interface RefinesTwo {
  extends B1;
  extends B2;
}
```

The `extends` declarations are in the body of the `interface` definition instead
of the header so we can use
[associated types (defined below)](#associated-types) also defined in the body
in parameters or constraints of the interface being extended.

```
interface A(Type:$ T) { ... }
interface B {
  var Type:$ T;
  extends A(T);
}
```

**Open question:** Can we redefine associated types in the refined interface as
long as the new definition is compatible but more specific ("covariance")? Here,
more specific means that the requirements and the name-to-binding map are
supersets.

```
interface ForwardContainer(Type:$ T) {
  var ForwardIterator(T):$ IteratorType;
  method (Ptr(Self): this) Begin() -> IteratorType;
  method (Ptr(Self): this) End() -> IteratorType;
}
interface BidirectionalContainer(Type:$ T) {
  var BidirectionalIterator(T):$ IteratorType;
  // Question: does this cause any weird shadowing?
  extends ForwardContainer(T, .IteratorType = IteratorType);
}
```

**Diamond dependency issue:** Since types can implement interfaces at most once,
we need to specify what happens in when a type implements interfaces `D1` and
`D2` both of which extend `B`.

```
interface B {
  method (Self: this) B1();
  method (Self: this) B2();
}
interface D1 { extends B; ... }
interface D2 { extends B; ... }
struct U {
  impl D1 { ... }
  impl D2 { ... }
}
```

We can only have one definition of each method of `B`. Each method though could
be defined in `D1`, `D2`, or `B`. These would all be valid:

-   `D1` implements all methods of `B`, `D2` implements none of them.

```
struct U {
  impl D1 {
    method (Self: this) B1() { ... }
    method (Self: this) B2() { ... }
  }
  impl D2 { ... }
}
```

-   `D1` and `D2` implement all methods of `B` between them, but with no
    overlap.

```
struct U {
  impl D1 {
    method (Self: this) B1() { ... }
  }
  impl D2 {
    method (Self: this) B2() { ... }
  }
}
```

-   We explicitly implement `B`.

```
struct U {
  impl B {
    method (Self: this) B1() { ... }
    method (Self: this) B2() { ... }
  }
  impl D1 { ... }
  impl D2 { ... }
}
```

The `extends` declaration makes sense with the same meaning inside a
[`structural interface`](#structural-interfaces), and should also be supported.

### Use case: overload resolution

Implementing an extended interface is an example of a more specific match for
[lookup resolution](#lookup-resolution). For example, this could be used to
provide different implementations of an algorithm depending on the capabilities
of the iterator being passed in:

```
interface ForwardIterator(Type:$ T) { ... }
interface BidirectionalIterator(Type:$ T) {
  extends ForwardIterator(T);  ...
}
interface RandomAccessIterator(Type:$ T) {
  extends BidirectionalIterator(T); ...
}

fn SearchInSortedList[Comparable:$ T, ForwardIterator(T): IterT]
    (IterT: begin, IterT: end, T: needle) -> Bool {
  // does linear search
}
// Will prefer the following overload when it matches since it is more specific.
fn SearchInSortedList[Comparable:$ T, RandomAccessIterator(T): IterT]
    (IterT: begin, IterT: end, T: needle) -> Bool {
  // does binary search
}
```

This would be an example of the more general rule that an interface `A`
requiring an implementation of interface `B` means `A` is more specific than
`B`.

## Type compatibility

None of the casts between facet types change the implementation of any
interfaces for a type. So the result of a cast does not depend on the sequence
of casts you perform, just the original type and the final type-type. That is,
these types will all be equal:

-   `T as I`
-   `(T as A) as I`
-   `(((T as A) as B) as C) as I`

Now consider a type with a generic type parameter, like a hash map type:

```
interface Hashable { ... }
struct HashMap(Hashable:$ KeyT, Type:$ ValueT) { ... }
```

If we write something like `HashMap(String, Int)` the type we actually get is:

```
HashMap(String as Hashable, Int as Type)
```

This is the same type we will get if we pass in some other facet types in, so
all of these types are equal:

-   `HashMap(String, Int)`
-   `HashMap(String as Hashable, Int as Type)`
-   `HashMap((String as Printable) as Hashable, Int)`
-   `HashMap((String as Printable + Hashable) as Hashable, Int)`

This means we don't generally need to worry about getting the wrong facet type
as the argument for a generic type. This means we don't get type mismatches when
calling functions as in this example, where the type parameters have different
constraints than the type requires:

```
fn PrintValue[
    Printable + Hashable:$ KeyT,
    Printable:$ ValueT](HashMap(KeyT, ValueT): map, KeyT: key) { ... }

var HashMap(String, Int): m;
PrintValue(m, "key");
```

## Adapting types

We also provide a way to create new types
[compatible with](https://github.com/josh11b/carbon-lang/blob/generics-docs/docs/design/generics/terminology.md#compatible-types)
existing types with different APIs, in particular with different interface
implementations, by
[adapting](https://github.com/josh11b/carbon-lang/blob/generics-docs/docs/design/generics/terminology.md#compatible-types)
them:

```
interface A { method (Self: this) F(); }
interface B { method (Self: this) G(); }
struct C {
  impl A { method (Self: this) F() { Print("CA"); } }
}
adaptor D for C {
  impl B { method (Self: this) G() { Print("DB"); } }
}
adaptor E for C {
  impl A { method (Self: this) F() { Print("EA"); } }
}
adaptor F for C {
  impl A = E as A;  // Possibly we'd allow "impl A = E;" here.
  impl B = D as B;
}
```

This allows us to provide implementations of new interfaces (as in `D`), provide
different implementations of the same interface (as in `E`), or mix and match
implementations from other compatible types (as in `F`). The rules are:

-   You may only add APIs, not change the representation of the type, unlike
    extending a type where you may add fields.
-   The adapted type is compatible with the original type, and that relationship
    is an equivalence class, so all of `C`, `D`, `E`, and `F` end up compatible
    with each other.
-   Since adapted types are compatible with the original type, you may
    explicitly cast between them, but there is no implicit casting between these
    types (unlike between a type and one of its facet types / impls).

The framework from the previous
[type compatibility section](#type-compatibility) allows us to evaluate when we
can cast between two different arguments to a parameterized type. Consider three
compatible types, all of which implement `Hashable`:

```
struct X {
  impl Hashable { ... }
  impl A { ... }
}
adaptor Y for X {
  impl Hashable { ... }
}
adaptor Z for X {
  impl Hashable = X as Hashable;
  impl B { ... }
}
```

Observe that `X as Hashable` is different from `Y as Hashable`, since they have
different definitions of the `Hashable` interface even though they are
compatible types since they use the same data representation. However
`X as Hashable` and `Z as Hashable` are almost the same. In addition to using
the same data representation, they both implement one interface, `Hashable`, and
use the same implementation for that interface. The one difference between them
is that `X as Hashable` may be implicitly cast to `X`, which implements
interface `A`, and `Z as Hashable` may be implicilty cast to `Z`, which
implements interface `B`. This means that it is safe to cast between
`HashMap(X, Int)` and `HashMap(Z, Int)` (though maybe only with an explicit
cast) but `HashMap(Y, Int)` is incompatible. This is a relief, because we know
that in practice the invariants of a `HashMap` implementation rely on the
hashing function staying the same.

**Comparison with other languages:** This matches the Rust construct called
`newtype`, which is used to implement traits on types while avoiding coherence
problems, see
[here](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch19-03-advanced-traits.html#using-the-newtype-pattern-to-implement-external-traits-on-external-types)
and
[here](https://github.com/Ixrec/rust-orphan-rules#user-content-why-are-the-orphan-rules-controversial).

### Example: Defining an impl for use by other types

Let's say we want to provide a possible implementation of an interface for use
by types for which that implementation would be appropriate. We can do that by
defining an adaptor implementing the interface that is parameterized on the type
it is adapting. That impl may then be pulled in using the `"impl ... = ...;"`
syntax.

```
interface Comparable {
  fn operator<(Self: this, Self: that) -> Bool;
  ... // And also for >, <=, etc.
}
adaptor ComparableFromDifferenceFn(Type:$ T,
                                   fnty(T, T)->Int:$ Difference)
    for T {
  impl Comparable {
    fn operator<(Self: this, Self: that) -> Bool {
      return Difference(this, that) < 0;
    }
    ... // And also for >, <=, etc.
  }
}
struct MyType {
  var Int: x;
  fn Difference(Self: this, Self: that) { return that.x - this.x; }
  impl Comparable = ComparableFromDifferenceFn(MyType, Difference) as Comparable;
}
```

### Associated constants

In addition to associated methods, we allow other kinds of associated items. For
consistency, we use the same syntax to describe a constant in an interface as in
a type without assigning a value. Since these are compile-time constants with
unknown value until compile time, they use the generic `:$` syntax. For example,
a fixed-dimensional point type could have the dimension as an associated
constant.

```
interface NSpacePoint {
  var Int:$ N;
  // The following require: 0 <= i < N.
  method (Ptr(Self): this) Get(Int: i) -> Float64;
  method (Ptr(Self): this) Set(Int: i, Float64 : value);
}
```

Implementations of `NSpacePoint` for different types might have different values
for `N`:

```
struct Point2D {
  impl NSpacePoint {
    var Int:$ N = 2;
    method (Ptr(Self): this) Get(Int: i) -> Float64 { ... }
    method (Ptr(Self): this) Set(Int: i, Float64: value) { ... }
  }
}

struct Point3D {
  impl NSpacePoint {
    var Int:$ N = 3;
    method (Ptr(Self): this) Get(Int: i) -> Float64 { ... }
    method (Ptr(Self): this) Set(Int: i, Float64: value) { ... }
  }
}
```

And these values may be accessed as follows:

```
Assert(Point2D.N == 2);
Assert(Point3D.N == 3);

fn PrintPoint[NSpacePoint:$ PointT](PointT: p) {
  for (var Int: i = 0; i < PointT.N; ++i) {
    if (i > 0) { Print(", "); }
    Print(p.Get(i));
  }
}

fn ExtractPoint[NSpacePoint:$ PointT](
    PointT: p,
    Ptr(Array(Float64, PointT.N)): dest) {
  for (var Int: i = 0; i < PointT.N; ++i) {
    (*dest)[i] = p.Get(i);
  }
}
```

To be consistent with normal function declaration syntax, function constants are
written:

```
interface DeserializeFromString {
  fn Deserialize(String: serialized) -> Self;
}

struct MySerializableType {
  var Int: i;

  impl DeserializeFromString {
    fn Deserialize(String: serialized) -> Self {
      return (.i = StringToInt(serialized));
    }
  }
}

var MySerializableType: x = MySerializableType.Deserialize("3");

fn Deserialize(DeserializeFromString:$ T, String: serialized) -> T {
  return T.Deserialize(serialized);
}
var MySerializableType: y = Deserialize(MySerializableType, "4");
```

**Aside:** In general, any field declared as "generic" (using the `:$` syntax),
will only have compile-time and not runtime storage associated with it.

TODO: Move the following to a dedicated constraints section.

We might need to write a function that only works with a specific value of `N`.
We solve this using the same approach of making each associated constant an
optional named parameter to the interface, as in:

```
fn PrintPoint2D[NSpacePoint:$ PointT(.N = 2)](PointT: p) {
  Print(p.Get(0), ", ", p.Get(1));
}
```

**Comparison with other languages:** This feature is also called
[associated constants in Rust](https://doc.rust-lang.org/reference/items/associated-items.html#associated-constants).

## Associated types

Associated types are associated constants that happen to be types. These are
particularly interesting since they can be used in the signatures of associated
methods or functions, to allow the signatures of methods to vary from
implementation to implementation. We already have one example of this: the
`Self` type discussed [above in the "Interfaces" section](#interfaces). For
other cases, we can say that the interface declares that each implementation
will provide a type under a specific name. For example:

```
interface Stack {
  var Type:$ ElementType;
  method (Ptr(Self): this) Push(ElementType: value);
  method (Ptr(Self): this) Pop() -> ElementType;
  method (Ptr(Self): this) IsEmpty() -> Bool;
}
```

Here we have an interface called `Stack` which defines two methods, `Push` and
`Pop`. The signatures of those two methods declared as accepting or returning
values with the type `ElementType`, which any implementer of `Stack` must also
define. For example, maybe `DynamicArray` implements `Stack`:

```
struct DynamicArray(Type:$ T) {
  // DynamicArray methods
  // Could use either `Self` or `DynamicArray(T)` here.
  method (Ptr(Self): this) PushBack(T: value);
  method (Ptr(Self): this) PopBack() -> T;
  method (Ptr(Self): this) IsEmpty() -> Bool;

  impl Stack {
    var Type:$ ElementType = T;
    // `Self` and `DynamicArray(T)` are still equivalent here.
    method (Ptr(Self): this) Push(ElementType: value) {
      this->PushBack(value);
    }
    method (Ptr(Self): this) Pop() -> ElementType {
      return this->PopBack();
    }
    // Use default version of IsEmpty() from DynamicArray.
  }
}
```

Now we can write a generic function that operates on anything implementing the
`Stack` interface, for example:

```
fn PeekAtTopOfStack[Stack:$ StackType](Ptr(StackType): s)
    -> StackType.ElementType {
  var StackType.ElementType: top = s->Pop();
  s->Push(top);
  return top;
}

var DynamicArray(Int): my_array = (1, 2, 3);
// PeekAtTopOfStack's StackType is set to (DynamicArray(Int) as Stack).
// StackType.ElementType becomes Int.
Assert(PeekAtTopOfStack(my_array) == 3);

For context, see
["Interface type parameters vs. associated types" in the Carbon: Generics Terminology doc](https://github.com/josh11b/carbon-lang/blob/generics-docs/docs/design/generics/terminology.md#interface-type-parameters-vs-associated-types).

**Comparison with other languages:** Both
[Rust](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch19-03-advanced-traits.html#specifying-placeholder-types-in-trait-definitions-with-associated-types)
and [Swift](https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/LanguageGuide/Generics.html#ID189)
support associated types.

### Constraints on associated types in interfaces

Now note that inside `PeekAtTopOfStack` we don't know anything about
`StackType.ElementType`, so we can't perform any operations on values of that
type, other than pass them to `Stack` methods. We can define an interface that
has an associated type constrained to satisfy an interface (or any
[other type-type](#adapting-types)). For example, we might say interface
`Container` has a `Begin` method returning values with type satisfying the
`Iterator` interface:

```
interface Iterator {
  method (Ptr(Self): this) Advance();
  ...
}
interface Container {
  var Iterator:$ IteratorType;
  method (Ptr(Self): this) Begin() -> IteratorType;
  ...
}
```

With this additional information, a function can now call `Iterator` methods on
the return value of `Begin`:

```
fn OneAfterBegin[Container:$ T](Ptr(T): c) -> T.IteratorType {
  var T.IteratorType: iter = c->Begin();
  iter.Advance();
  return iter;
}
```

#### Model

The associated type is modeled by a witness table field in the interface.

```
struct Iterator(Type:$ Self) {
  var fnty(Ptr(Self): this): Advance;
  ...
}
struct Container(Type:$ Self) {
  var Type:$ IteratorType;  // Representation type for the iterator.
  // Witness that IteratorType implements Iterator.
  var Ptr(Iterator(IteratorType)): iterator_impl;
  method (Ptr(Self): this) Begin() -> IteratorType;
  ...
}
```

#### External constraints via optional parameters

Users of an interface may also want to introduce constraints on an associated
type, in addition to constraints in the definition of the interface. To support
this, we automatically make every associated type an optional named parameter to
the interface. For example, we could make a the `ElementType` of an `Iterator`
interface equal to the `ElementType` of a `Container` interface as follows:

```
interface Iterator {
  var Type:$ ElementType;
  ...
}
interface Container {
  var Type:$ ElementType;
  var Iterator(.ElementType = ElementType):$ IteratorType;
  ...
}
```

Functions accepting a generic type might also want to constrain an associated
type. For example, we might want to have a function only accept stacks
containing integers:

```
fn SumIntStack[Stack(.ElementType = Int):$ T](Ptr(T): s) -> Int {
  var Int: sum = 0;
  while (!s->IsEmpty()) {
    sum += s->Pop();
  }
  return sum;
}
```

Or you might constrain the element type to satisfy an interface (`Comparable` in
this example) without saying exactly what type it is:

```
fn SortContainer[Comparable:$ ElementType,
                 Container(.ElementType = ElementType):$ ContainerType]
    (Ptr(ContainerType): container_to_sort);
```

These different types of constraints can be combined. For example, this example
expresses a constraint that two associated types are equal and satisfy an
interface:

```
// CT1.ElementType == CT2.ElementType
// CT1.ElementType implements HasEquality
fn EqualContainers[HasEquality:$ ET,
                   Container(.ElementType = ET):$ CT1,
                   Container(.ElementType = ET):$ CT2]
    (Ptr(CT1): c1, Ptr(CT2): c2) -> Bool;
```

This approach has a few advantages:

-   There is one mechanism for constraining an interface: passing in arguments.
    We use this both for [interface parameters](#parameterized-interfaces)
    (required, typically positional parameters) and associated types (optional,
    named parameters).
-   You can express a variety of constraints, including that two things must be
    the same, something must take on a specific value, or something must satisfy
    an interface.
-   Deciding if two types must always be the same can be done just by
    normalizing their expressions by substituting any parameters. For example,
    `Container.IteratorType.ElementType` normalizes to `Container.ElementType`.
    In the case of the `SortContainer` function, there is an additional
    constraint making `ContainerType.IteratorType.ElementType` and
    `ContainerType.ElementType` both equal to `ElementType`.
-   Many constrained interfaces are naturally represented as type-types, which
    is useful for constructs like [`DynPtr`](#dynamic-pointer-type) or
    [`DynBoxed`](#dynboxed) that are parameterized by type-types.

**Rejected alternative:** Other languages use `requires` clauses to expressed
constraints, as discussed in
[this appendix](https://github.com/josh11b/carbon-lang/blob/generics-docs/docs/design/generics/appendix-requires-constraints.md).

#### Tricky cases

TODO: Want to be able to say "The slice type for a container is another
container, with a constraint saying it is idempotent." That is, we want to write
a constraint saying `Container.SliceType.SliceType == Container.SliceType`,
which is straightforward using a `requires` clause. Unfortunately, this
definition doesn't work:

```
interface Container {
  var Type:$ ElementType;
  var Iterator(.ElementType = ElementType):$ IteratorType;
  // PROBLEM: recursive definition, requires forward reference
  var Container(.ElementType = ElementType, .SliceType = SliceType):$ SliceType;
  method (Ptr(Self): this) GetSlice(IteratorType: start,
                                    IteratorType: end) -> SliceType;
}
```

Unfortunately writing a separate `alias` or
[structural interface](#structural-interfaces) to represent the constraint
doesn't work here. All of these refer to `Container` and so can only be defined
afterwards and can't be used to define `Container` itself:

```
alias ContainerAsSlice = Container(.SliceType = Self);
// Really we want to support things like `ContainerAsSlice(.ElementType = ...)`
// so we need alias definitions to support something like:
alias ContainerAsSlice(auto...:$$ args) =
    Container(args..., .SliceType = Self);

// Alternative using `structural interface`, assuming we supports `extends`
// like ordinary `interface` definitions.
structural interface ContainerAsSlice {
  extends Container(.SliceType = Self);
}
```

TODO: Add context where this was originally discussed
[here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1YjF1jcXCSb4zQ4kCcZFAK5jtbIJh9IdaaTbzmQEwSNg/edit#heading=h.eak2vxz3de3v).

### Constraints that are hard to express

**Concern:** It is difficult to express some kinds of constraints in this
framework: mathematical constraints on values (for example, "`NTuple` where `N`
is at least 2"), and inequality type constraints (for example "type is not
`Bool`").

You might need an inequality type constraint, for example, to control overload
resolution:

```
fn F[Type:$ T](T: x) -> T { return x; }
fn F(Bool: x) -> String {
  if (x) return "True"; else return "False";
}

fn G[Type:$ T](T: x) -> T {
  // We need a T != Bool constraint for this to type check.
  return F(x);
}
```

Another use case for inequality type constraints would be to say something like
"define `ComparableTo(T1)` for `T2` if `ComparableTo(T2)` is defined for `T1`
and `T1 != T2`".

**Future work:** Right now the only suggestion on the table is some sort of
boolean condition that can be evaluated by the caller at compile time included
as an optional clause in the function signature:

```
fn TakesAtLeastAPair[Int:$ N](NTuple(N, Int): x) if (N >= 2) { ... }

fn G[Type:$ T](T: x) -> T if (T != Bool) { return F(x); }

fn PrintPoint2Or3[NSpacePoint:$ PointT](PointT: p)
  if (2 <= PointT.N && PointT.N <= 3) { ... }
```

## Parameterized interfaces

Some type constraints would be more conveniently expressed by moving from
[associated types](#associated-types) to
[type parameters for interfaces](https://github.com/josh11b/carbon-lang/blob/generics-docs/docs/design/generics/terminology.md#interface-type-parameters-vs-associated-types).
The syntax for type parameters is that we allow a parameter list after the name
of the interface:

```
interface Stack(Type:$ ElementType) {
  method (Ptr(Self): this) Push(ElementType: value);
  method (Ptr(Self): this) Pop() -> ElementType;
  method (Ptr(Self): this) IsEmpty() -> Bool;
}
struct DynamicArray(Type:$ T) {
  ...
  // References to a parameterized interface must be followed by an
  //  argument list with specific values for every parameter.
  impl Stack(T) { ... }
}
```

All interface parameters must be marked as "generic", using the `:$` syntax.
This reflects these two properties of these parameters:

-   They must be resolved at compile-time, and so can't be passed regular
    dynamic values.
-   We allow either generic or template values to be passed in.

It is a little more convenient to express type constraints on type parameters
than associated types, since you don't need to specify the name:

```
// Stack.ElementType constrained to be Int.
fn SumIntStack[Stack(Int):$ T](Ptr(T): s) -> Int { ... }

interface Iterator(Type:$ ElementType) { ... }
interface Container(Type:$ ElementType) {
  // IteratorType constrained to implement the Iterator interface,
  // with matching ElementType.
  var Iterator(ElementType):$ IteratorType;
  ...
}

// ElementType of the two containers constrained to match and
// implement HasEquality interface.
fn EqualContainers[HasEquality:$ ElementType,
                   Container(ElementType):$ CT1,
                   Container(ElementType):$ CT2]
    (Ptr(CT1): c1, Ptr(CT2): c2) -> Bool { ... }
```

Note that the way to express constraints on type parameters is consistent with
treating associated types as optional parameters.

But it is more awkward in the unconstrained case, since you still need to pass
something in that position. That is both more ceremony for something you didn't
care about, and creates an issue of how that parameter is determined.

**Proposal:** A type will be by default only allowed one implementation of an
interface, not one per interface & type parameter combination.

The advantage of this approach is that it makes inferring the type parameters
unambiguous. This allows us to use a parameterized interface in cases where we
don't know the type parameter. For example, to write `PeekAtTopOfStack` from the
[associated types section](#associated-types) with the parameterized version of
`Stack`, we need to infer the `ElementType`:

```
fn PeekAtTopOfStack[Type:$ ElementType, Stack(ElementType):$ StackType]
    (Ptr(StackType): s) -> ElementType { ... }
```

The alternative of one implementation per interface & type parameter combination
is perhaps more natural. It seems useful for something like a `ComparableTo(T)`
interface, where a type might be comparable with multiple other types. It does
have a problem where you need to be certain that every impl of an interface for
a parameterized type can be distinguished:

```
interface Map(Type:$ FromType, Type:$ ToType) {
  method (Ptr(Self): this) Map(FromType: needle) -> Optional(ToType);
}
struct Bijection(Type:$ FromType, Type:$ ToType) {
  impl Map(FromType, ToType) { ... }
  impl Map(ToType, FromType) { ... }
}
// Error: Bijection has two impls of interface Dictionary(String, String)
var Bijection(String, String): oops = ...;
```

In this case, it would be better to have an adapting type to contain the impl
for the reverse map lookup:

```
struct Bijection(Type:$ FromType, Type:$ ToType) {
  impl Map(FromType, ToType) { ... }
}
adaptor ReverseLookup(Type:$ FromType, Type:$ ToType)
    for Bijection(FromType, ToType) {
  impl Map(ToType, FromType) { ... }
}
```

This would be the preferred approach to use instead of multiple impls of the
same interface.

**Proposal:** You can opt in to allowing multiple impls for a type by using a
keyword annotation on the type parameter to an interface, for now `multi`. Multi
type parameters to interfaces generally won't be inferred / deduced (at least
not in a context where only one answer is allowed).

This will be the approach used for `ComparableTo(T)`, `ConstructibleFrom(...)`,
or other operators that might have multiple overloads. Example:

```
interface EqualityComparableTo(multi Type:$ T) {  // Note: multi
  fn operator==(Self: this, T: that) -> Bool;
  ...
}
struct Complex {
  var Float64: real;
  var Float64: imag;
  // Can implement this interface more than once as long as it has different
  // arguments.
  impl EqualityComparableTo(Complex) { ... }
  impl EqualityComparableTo(Float64) { ... }
}
```

Observation: While you can switch between regular ("inferable") parameters and
associated types, a `multi` parameter can't be changed to an associated type.

**Rationale:** Reasons to support parameterized interfaces:

-   In Carbon we are consistently allowing constructs to be parameterized.
-   Some things are more naturally represented by required, positional
    parameters (as opposed to associated types, which are optional and named).
-   Parameterized interfaces support cases where one type implements an
    interface multiple times with different parameters (`multi` parameters),
    unlike associated types. For example, a type might be comparable with
    multiple other types. We expect to need this for operator overloading.

**Rejected alternative:** We could simplify the language by making all interface
parameters be `multi`. You would instead use associated types for anything
deducible. I (Josh11b) think this degrades the usability overall, but is a
viable option, and simplifies the language. This is what Rust does.

**Comparison with other languages:** Rust calls
[traits with type parameters "generic traits"](https://doc.rust-lang.org/reference/items/traits.html#generic-traits)
and
[uses them for operator overloading](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch19-03-advanced-traits.html#default-generic-type-parameters-and-operator-overloading).
Note that Rust further supports defaults for those type parameters (such as
`Self`).

### Impl lookup and specialization

Let's say you have some interface `I(T, U(V))` being implemented for some type
`A(B(C(D), E))`. That impl must be defined in the same library that defines the
interface or one of the names needed by the type. That is, the impl must be
defined with (exactly) one of `I`, `A`, `B`, `C`, `D`, or `E`. Note that you
can't define the impl with `T`, `U`, `V`, or any other library unless it also
defines one of `I`, `A`, ..., or `E`. We further require anything looking up
this impl to import the _definitions_ of all of those names. Seeing a forward
declaration of these names is insufficient, since you can presumably see forward
declarations without seeing an impl with the definition. This accomplishes a few
goals:

-   The compiler can check that there is only one definition of any impl that is
    actually used, avoiding
    [One Definition Rule (ODR)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_Definition_Rule)
    problems.
-   Every attempt to use an impl will see the exact same impl, making the
    interpretation and semantics of code consistent no matter its context, in
    accordance with the
    [Refactoring principle](https://github.com/josh11b/carbon-lang/blob/principle-refactoring/docs/project/principles/principle-refactoring.md).
-   Allowing the impl to be defined with either the interface or the type
    addresses the
    [expression problem](https://eli.thegreenplace.net/2016/the-expression-problem-and-its-solutions).

Note that interface parameters are treated differently because they can be
inferred as part of calling a function call, as described in
[this appendix](https://github.com/josh11b/carbon-lang/blob/generics-docs/docs/design/generics/appendix-interface-param-impl.md).
We could allow implementations to be defined with arguments that can't be
inferred (`multi` parameters), if we were willing to use a more complicated
rule.

### Parameterized structural interfaces

We should also allow the [structural interface](#structural-interfaces)
construct to support parameters. Parameters marked `multi` would work the same
way as for regular (nominal/non-structural) interfaces. We should only allow
parameters to be deducible (no `multi`) when they can be deduced unambiguously.
For example, if the structural interface has a `T` parameter that is passed as
an argument to a deducible parameter of an interface requirement, like
`impl RequiredInterface(T)`, then `T` can be deduced as well.

## Naming constraints

Given these definitions:

```
interface IteratorInterface(Type:$ ElementType) { ... }
interface RandomAccessIterator(Type:$ ElementType) {
  extends IteratorInterface(ElementType);
  ...
}
interface ContainerInterface(Type:$ ElementType) {
  var IteratorInterface(ElementType):$ IteratorType;
  ...
}
```

TODO: We would like to be able to define a `RandomAccessContainer(T)` to be a
type-type whose types satisfy `ContainerInterface(T)` with an `IteratorType`
satisfying `RandomAccessIterator(T)`.

```
fn F[Type:$ T,
     RandomAccessIterator(T):$ IterType,
     ContainerInterface(T, .IteratorType=IterType):$ ContainerType]
  (ContainerType: c);

// WANT a definition of RandomAccessContainer(T) such that the above
// is equivalent to:
fn F[Type:$ T, RandomAccessContainer(T):$ ContainerType](ContainerType: c);
```

A similar problem where we want to constrain two parameters to be the same.

```
// Given a function `G` defined:
fn G[Type:$ T, PairInterface(T, T):$ U](U: u);
// Want to define `Double(T)` so this is equivalent:
fn G[Type:$ T, Double(T):$ U](U: u);

// The following works if we support `extends` for `structural interface`
// to mean the same thing as for regular nominal `interface` definitions:
structural interface Double(Type:$ T) { extends PairInterface(T, T); }
// Similarly we might support this using an `alias`:
alias Double(Type:$ T) = PairInterface(T, T);
```

## Implicit constraints

TODO

## Generic type equality

TODO

## Conditional conformance

The problem we are trying to solve here is expressing that we have an impl of
some interface for some type, but only if some additional type restrictions are
met. To do this, we leverage [external impl](#external-impl):

-   We can provide the same impl argument in two places to constrain them to be
    the same.
-   We can declare the impl argument with a more-restrictive type, to e.g. say
    this impl can only be used if that type satisfies an interface.

**Example:** [Interface constraint] Here we implement the `Printable` interface
for arrays of `N` elements of `Printable` type `T`, generically for `N`.

```
interface Printable {
  method (Ptr(Self): this) Print() -> String;
}
struct FixedArray(Type:$ T, Int:$ N) { ... }

// By saying "Printable:$ T" instead of "Type:$ T" here, we constrain
// T to be Printable for this impl.
extend FixedArray(Printable:$ T, Int:$ N) {
  impl Printable {
    method (Ptr(Self): this) Print() -> String {
      var Bool: first = False;
      var String: ret = "";
      for (auto: a) in *this {
        if (!first) {
          ret += ", ";
        }
        ret += a.Print();
      }
      return ret;
    }
  }
}
```

**Example:** [Same-type constraint] We implement interface `Foo(T)` for
`Pair(T, U)` when `T` and `U` are the same.

```
interface Foo(Type:$ T) { ... }
struct Pair(Type:$ T, Type:$ U) { ... }
extend Pair(Type:$ T, T) {
  impl Foo(T) { ... }
}
// Alternatively:
extend Pair[Type:$ T](T, T) {
  impl Foo(T) { ... }
}
```

**Proposal:** [Other boolean condition constraints] Just like we support
conditions when pattern matching (for example in overload resolution), we should
also allow them when defining an impl:

```
extend[Type:$$ T] T if (sizeof(T) <= 16) {
  impl Foo { ... }
}
```

**Concern:** The conditional conformance feature makes the question "is this
interface implemented for this type" undecidable in general.
[This feature in Rust has been shown to allow implementing a Turing machine](https://sdleffler.github.io/RustTypeSystemTuringComplete/).
This means we will likely need some heuristic like a limit on how many steps of
recursion are allowed.

**Open question:** We could also have a syntax for defining these impls inline
in the struct definition, but I haven't found a syntax that works as well as the
`extend` statement constructs shown above. We have a choice between two evils:
either the meaning of the names defined in the outer struct change inside the
conditional impl, or we end up having to give new names to the same values. This
was discussed in
[Carbon meeting Nov 27, 2019 on Generics & Interfaces (TODO)](#broken-links-footnote)<!-- T:Carbon meeting Nov 27, 2019 on Generics & Interfaces --><!-- A:#heading=h.gebr4cdi0y8o -->.

The best idea I've had so far is to include an `extend` statement inside the
`struct` definition to make it inline:

```
struct FixedArray(Type:$ T, Int:$ N) {
  // A few different syntax possibilities here:
  extend FixedArray(Printable:$ P, Int:$ N2) { impl Printable { ... } }
  extend FixedArray(Printable:$ P, N) { impl Printable { ... } }
  extend[Printable:$ P] FixedArray(P, N) { impl Printable { ... } }
}

struct Pair(Type:$ T, Type:$ U) {
  extend Pair(T, T) { impl Foo(T) { ... } }
}
```

We would need rules to prevent inconsistent reuse of the names from the outer
scope. This proposal has the desirable property that the syntax for internal vs.
external conditional conformance matches. This makes it straightforward to
refactor between those two choices, and is easier to learn.

Some other ideas we have considered lack this consistency:

-   One approach would be to use implicit arguments in square brackets after the
    `impl` keyword, and an `if` clause to add constraints:

```
struct FixedArray(Type:$ T, Int:$ N) {
  impl[Printable:$ U] Printable if T == U {
    // Here `T` and `U` have the same value and so you can freely
    // cast between them. The difference is that you can call the
    // `Print` method on values of type `U`.
  }
}

struct Pair(Type:$ T, Type:$ U) {
  impl Foo(T) if T == U {
    // Can cast between `Pair(T, U)` and `Pair(T, T)` since `T == U`.
  }
}
```

-   Another approach is to use pattern matching instead of boolean conditions.
    This might look like (though it introduces another level of indentation):

```
struct FixedArray(Type:$ T, Int:$ N) {
  @if let Printable:$ P = T {
    impl Printable { ... }
  }
}

interface Foo(Type:$ T) { ... }
struct Pair(Type:$ T, Type:$ U) {
  @if let Pair(T, T):$ P = Self {
    impl Foo(T) { ... }
  }
}
```

We can have this consistency, but lose the property that all unqualified names
for a type come from its `struct definition:

-   We could keep `extend` statements outside of the struct block to avoid
    sharing names between scopes, but allow them to have an `internal` keyword
    (as long as it is in the same library).

```
struct FixedArray(Type:$ T, Int:$ N) { ... }
extend FixedArray(Printable:$ P, Int:$ N) internal { impl Printable { ... } }

struct Pair(Type:$ T, Type:$ U) { ... }
extend Pair(Type:$ T, T) internal { ... }
```

Lastly, we could adopt a "flow sensitive" approach, where the meaning of names
can change in an inner scope. This would allow the `if` conditions that govern
when an impl is used to affect the types in that impl's definition:

```
struct FixedArray(Type:$ T, Int:$ N) {
  impl Printable if (T implements Printable) {
    // Inside this scope, `T` has type `Printable` instead of `Type`.
  }
}
```

This would require mechanisms to both describe these conditions and determine
how they affect types.

**Future work:** Rust uses this mechanism (TODO: find link) to also allow
conditionally defining methods on types, independent of interfaces. This is not
specific to generics, but we would like to have a syntax that is consistent
across these two use cases. The above "inline `extend`" syntax does naturally
generalize to this case:

```
struct FixedArray(Type:$ T, Int:$ N) {
  // ...
  extend[Printable:$ P] FixedArray(P, N) {
    method (Ptr(Self): this) Print() { ... }
  }
}

// FixedArray(T, N) has a `Print()` method if `T` is `Printable`.
```

## Templated impls for generic interfaces

Some things going on here:

-   Our syntax for `extend` statements already allows you to have a templated
    type parameter. This can be used to provide a general impl that depends on
    templated access to the type, even though the interface itself is defined
    generically.
-   We very likely will want to restrict the impl in some ways.
    -   Easy case: An impl for a family of parameterized types.
    -   Trickier is "structural conformance": we might want to say "here is an
        impl for interface `Foo` for any class implementing a method `Bar`".
        TODO: real use case.

### Structural conformance

**Question:** How do you say: "restrict this impl to types that have a member
function with a specific name & signature"?

An important use case is to restrict templated definitions to an appropriate set
of types.

**Decision:** We don't want to support the
[SFINAE rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substitution_failure_is_not_an_error)
of C++ because it does not let the user clearly express the intent of which
substitution failures are meant to be constraints and which are bugs.
Furthermore, the
[SFINAE rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substitution_failure_is_not_an_error)
leads to problems where the constraints can change accidentally as part of
modifications to the body that were not intended to affect the constraints at
all. As such, constraints should only be in the impl signature rather than be
determined by anything in the body.

**Decision:** We don't want anything like `LegalExpression(...)` for turning
substitution success/failure into True/False at this time, since we believe that
it introduces a lot of complexity, and we would rather lean on conforming to an
interface or the reflection APIs. However, we feel less strongly about this
position than the previous position and we may revisit (say because of needing a
bridge for C++ users). One nice property of the `LegalExpression(...)` paradigm
for expressing a constraint is that it would be easy for the constraint to
mirror code from the body of the function.

**Additional concern:** We want to be able to express "method has a signature"
in terms of the types involved, without necessarily any legal example values for
those types. For example, we want to be able to express that "`T` is
constructible from `U` if it has a `operator create` method that takes a `U`
value", without any way to write down an particular value for `U` in general:

```
interface ConstructibleFrom(multi ...:$ Args) { ... }
extend[Type:$$ T, Type:$$ U] T if (LegalExpression(T.operator create(???))) {
  impl ConstructibleFrom(U) { ... }
}
```

This is a problem for the `LegalExpression(...)` model, another reason to avoid
it.

**Possible answer:** likely we will write constraints using the reflection API,
though it isn't written at this time. The advantage of this approach is that we
likely will want a reflection API anyway for use in metaprogramming, so reusing
that instead of introducing another mechanism reduces complexity.

TODO: Go interface structural matching -- do we really want that? Could really
help with decoupling dependencies, breaking cycles, cleaning up layering.
Example: two libraries can be combined without knowing about each other.

**Possible answer:** Another approach would be define a function that returns a
type-type that matches types satisfying a structural constraint. This structural
constraint might be represented by a list of name, signature pairs encoded as
keyword arguments, as in:

> `HasFunction(.Name1 = FnType1, .Name2 = FnType2)` defines a type-type whose
> values are types with at least a method named `Name1` with signature matching
> the function type `FnType1` and a method name `Name2` with signature matching
> the function type `FnType2`.

Example:

```
fn CallsFooAndBar[HasFunction(.Foo = fnty(Int:_)->String,
                              .Bar = fnty(String:_)->Bool):$$ T]
    (T: x, Int: y) -> Bool {
  return x.Bar(x.Foo(y));
}
```

One downside of this approach is that it does not provide a way to write down
signatures that involve `Self`. Supporting that may require something a bit more
cumbersome:

```
HasMethod(fnty(Type:$$ Self)->(.Foo = fnty(Self:_, Int:_)->String,
                               .Bar = fnty(Self:_, String:_)->Bool))
```

**Possible answer:** A last possibility: anonymous interfaces would match
structurally. Just as types with names use nominative typing and types without
names are compared structurally, we could say that an interface defined without
a name is automatically implemented for any type that structurally matches the
API defined in the interface.

```
interface {
  fn Foo(Int: _) -> String;
  fn Bar(String: _) -> Bool;
}
```

This has the benefit that signatures involving `Self` are much more natural to
write using the machinery and syntax already associated with defining
interfaces.

```
interface {
  fn Foo(Self: _, Int: _) -> String;
  fn Bar(Self: _, String: _) -> Bool;
}
```

To give a name to this type-type while staying with structural conformance, use
the `alias` facility:

```
alias HasFooAndBar = interface {
  fn Foo(Int: _) -> String;
  fn Bar(String: _) -> Bool;
}
fn CallsFooAndBar[HasFooAndBar:$$ T](T: x, Int: y) -> Bool { ... }
```

Unfortunately, the difference between `alias Foo = interface { ... }` and
`interface Foo { ... }` is pretty subtle but important. It might be better to
instead have a keyword to draw attention to this difference, like:

```
structural interface HasFooAndBar {
  fn Foo(Int: _) -> String;
  fn Bar(String: _) -> Bool;
}
```

### Bridge for C++ templates

#### Calling C++ template code from Carbon

Let's say we want to call some templated C++ code from generic Carbon code.

```
// In C++
template<class T>
struct S {
  void F(T* t);
};
```

We first define the common API for the template:

```
// In Carbon
interface SInterface(Type:$ T) {
  method (Ptr(Self): this) F(Ptr(T): t);
}
```

and once we implement that interface for the C++ type `S`:

```
// Note: T has to be a templated argument to be usable with the
// C++ template `S`. There is no problem passing a template
// argument `T` to the generic argument of `SInterface`.
extend C++::S(Type:$$ T) {
  impl SInterface(T) {
    method (Ptr(Self): this) F(Ptr(T): t) { this->F(t); }
  }
}
```

we can then call it from a generic Carbon function:

```
fn G[Type:$ T, SInterface(T):$ SType](Ptr(SType): s, Ptr(T): t) {
  s->F(t);
}
var C++::S(Int) : x;
var Int : y = 3;
G(&x, &y);  // C++::S(Int) implements SInterface(Int) via templated impl
```

#### Moving a C++ template to Carbon

Imagine we have a C++ templated type with (possibly templated) consumers in C++,
and we want to migrate that type to Carbon. For example, say we have a template
`C++::Foo` in C++, and are moving it to Carbon generic `Foo`. Let's say the
`C++::Foo` template takes optional parameters, `C++::std::optional<T>` for any
`T`, but of course the way template code is typically written is to make it work
with anything that has the `C++::std::optional<T>` API. When we move it to
generic `Foo` in Carbon, we need both the `T` argument, and a
[higher-ranked](#bookmark=id.kayz42hh0s7j) type parameter to represent the
optional type. Some C++ users will continue to use this type with C++'s
`std::optional<T>`, which by virtue of being a C++ template, can't take generic
arguments. We still can make a templated implementation of a generic interface
for it:

```
interface Optional(Type:$ T) { ... }
extend C++::std::optional(Type:$$ T) {
  impl Optional(T) { ... }
}
```

### Subtlety around interfaces with multi parameters

Since interfaces with `multi` parameters can have multiple implementations for a
single type, it opens the question of how they work when implementing one
interface in terms of another.

**Open question:** We could allow templated impls to take each of these multiple
implementations for one interface and manufacture an impl for another interface,
as in this example:

```
// Some interfaces with multi type parameters.
interface EqualityComparableTo(multi Type:$ T) { ... }
// Types can implement templated interfaces more than once as long as the
// templated arguments differ.
struct Complex {
  var Float64: r;
  var Float64: i;
  impl EqualityComparableTo(Complex) { ... }
  impl EqualityComparableTo(Float64) { ... }
}
// Some other interface with a multi type parameter.
interface Foo(multi Type:$ T) { ... }
// This provides an impl of Foo(T) for U if U is EqualityComparableTo(T).
// In the case of Complex, this provides two impls, one for T == Complex,
// and one for T == Float64.
extend [EqualityComparableTo(Type:$$ T):$ U] U {
  impl Foo(T) { ... }
}
```

One tricky part of this is that you may not have visibility into all the impls
of an interface for a type since they may be
[defined with one of the other types involved](#impl-lookup-and-specialization).
Hopefully this isn't a problem -- you will always be able to see the _relevant_
impls given the types that have been imported / have visible definitions.

### Lookup resolution

**Rule:** Can have multiple impl definitions that match, as long as there is a
single best match. Best is defined using the "more specific" partial ordering:

-   Matching a descendant type or descendant interface is more specific and
    therefore a closer match than a parent type or interface.
-   Matching an exact type (`Foo` or `Foo(Bar)`) is more specific than a
    parameterized family of types (`Foo(T)` for any type `T`) is more specific
    than a generic type (`T` for any type `T`).
-   A more restrictive constraint is more specific. In particular, a type-type
    `T` is more restrictive than a type-type `U` if the set of restrictions for
    `T` is a superset of those for `U`. So `Foo(T)` for
    `Comparable + Printable:$ T` is more specific than `Comparable:$ T`, which
    is more specific than `Type:$ T`.
-   TODO: others?

The ability to have a more specific implementation used in place of a more
general is commonly called _specialization_.

TODO: Examples

**Implication:** Can't do impl lookup with generic arguments, even if you can
see a matching templated definition, since there may be a more-specific match
and we want to be assured that we always get the same result any time we do an
impl lookup.

TODO: Example

**Open question:** Rust
[doesn't allow specialization of a general implementation unless its items are marked `default`](https://rust-lang.github.io/rfcs/1210-impl-specialization.html#the-default-keyword).
Is that something we want to require? This would allow us to relax the
restriction of the previous implication for items that may not be specialized.

**Future Work:** Rust's
[specialization rules](https://rust-lang.github.io/rfcs/1210-impl-specialization.html#the-default-keyword)
allow you to omit definitions in the more specific implementation, using the
definition in the more general implementation as a default. It furthermore
supports defining a general
[`default impl`](https://rust-lang.github.io/rfcs/1210-impl-specialization.html#default-impls)
that is incomplete (in fact this feature was originally called "partial impl")
and _only_ used to provide default implementations for more specialized
implementations.

**Comparison with other languages:** See
[Rust's rules for deciding which impl is more specific](https://rust-lang.github.io/rfcs/1210-impl-specialization.html#defining-the-precedence-rules).

## Composition of type-types

So we have one way of defining a type-type: every interface is represented by a
type-type. In addition, Carbon defines `Type`, the type-type whose values
include every type. We now introduce ways of defining new type-types in terms of
other type-types.

### Type compatible with another type

Given a type-type `TT` and a type `U`, define the type-type
`CompatibleWith(TT, U)` as follows:

> `CompatibleWith(TT, U)` is a type whose values are types `T` such that:
>
> -   `T` has type `TT`.
> -   `T` and `U` are
>     [compatible](https://github.com/josh11b/carbon-lang/blob/generics-docs/docs/design/generics/terminology.md#compatible-types).
>     That is values of types `T` and `U` can be cast back and forth without any
>     change in representation (e.g. `T` is an [adaptor](#adapting-types) for
>     `U`).

**Note:** We require the user to supply `TT` and `U`, they may not be inferred.
Specifically, this code would be illegal:

```
fn Illegal[Type:$ U, CompatibleWith(TT, U):$ T](Ptr(T): x) ...
```

In general there would be multiple choices for `U` given a specific `T` here,
and no good way of picking one. However, similar code is allowed if there is
another way of determining `U`:

```
fn Allowed[Type:$ U, CompatibleWith(TT, U):$ T](Ptr(U): x, Ptr(T): y) ...
```

#### Example: Multiple implementations of the same interface

This allows us to represent functions that accept multiple implementations of
the same interface for a type.

```
enum CompareResult { Less, Equal, Greater }
interface Comparable {
  method (Self: this) Compare(Self: that) -> CompareResult;
}
fn CombinedLess[Type:$ T](T: a, T: b,
                          CompatibleWith(Comparable, T):$ U,
                          CompatibleWith(Comparable, T):$ V) -> Bool {
  match ((a as U).Compare(b)) {
    case CompareResult.Less => { return True; }
    case CompareResult.Greater => { return False; }
    case CompareResult.Equal => {
      return (a as V).Compare(b) == CompareResult.Less;
    }
  }
}
```

Used as:

```
struct Song { ... }
adaptor SongByArtist for Song { impl Comparable { ... } }
adaptor SongByTitle for Song { impl Comparable { ... } }
assert(CombinedLess(Song(...), Song(...), SongByArtist, SongByTitle) == True);
```

We might generalize this to a list of implementations:

```
fn CombinedCompare[Type:$ T]
    (T: a, T: b, List(CompatibleWith(Comparable, T)):$ CompareList)
    -> CompareResult {
  for (auto: U) in CompareList {
    var CompareResult: result = (a as U).Compare(b);
    if (result != CompareResult.Equal) {
      return result;
    }
  }
  return CompareResult.Equal;
}

assert(CombinedCompare(Song(...), Song(...), (SongByArtist, SongByTitle)) ==
       CompareResult.Less);
```

#### Example: Creating an impl out of other impls

And then to package this functionality as an implementation of `Comparable`, we
combine `CompatibleWith` with [type adaptation](#adapting-types):

```
adaptor ThenCompare(Type:$ T,
                    List(CompatibleWith(Comparable, T)):$ CompareList) for T {
  impl Comparable {
    method (Self: this) Compare(Self: that) -> CompareResult {
      for (auto : U) in CompareList {
        var CompareResult: result = (this as U).Compare(that);
        if (result != CompareResult.Equal) {
          return result;
        }
      }
      return CompareResult.Equal;
    }
  }
}

alias SongByArtistThenTitle = ThenCompare(Song, (SongByArtist, SongByTitle));
var Song: song = ...;
var SongByArtistThenTitle: song2 = Song(...) as SongByArtistThenTitle;
assert((song as SongByArtistThenTitle).Compare(song2) == CaompareResult.Less);
```

### Other type constraints

Some constraints, such as that some [type parameter](#parameterized-interfaces)
or [associated type](#associated-types) must implement an interface or that two
must be equal, are
[represented using multiple clauses](#external-constraints-via-optional-parameters)
rather than a single type-type. Sometimes we may need a single type-type, such
as to define a `DynPtr(TT)` (as
[described in the following dynamic pointer type section](#dynamic-pointer-type)).

We recommend that these constraints should be expressed as a
[structural interface](#structural-interfaces).

#### Rejected alternative: `ForSome(F)`

Another way to solve this problem would be to have a `ForSome(F)` construct,
where `F` is a function from types to type-types.

> `ForSome(F)`, where `F` is a function from type `T` to type-type `TT`, is a
> type whose values are types `U` with type `TT=F(T)` for some type `T`.

**Example:** Pairs of values where both values have the same type might be
written as

```
fn F[ForSome(lambda (Type:$ T) => PairInterface(T, T)):$ MatchedPairType]
    (Ptr(MatchedPairType): x) { ... }
```

This would be equivalent to:

```
fn F[Type:$ T, PairInterface(T, T):$ MatchedPairType]
    (Ptr(MatchedPairType): x) { ... }
```

**Example:** Containers where the elements implement the `HasEquality` interface
might be written as:

```
fn F[ForSome(lambda (HasEquality:$ T) => Container(T)):$ ContainerType]
  (Ptr(ContainerType): x) { ... }
```

This would be equivalent to:

```
fn F[HasEquality:$ T, Container(T):$ ContainerType]
  (Ptr(ContainerType): x) { ... }
```

### Sized types and type-types

What is the size of a type?

-   It could be fully known and fixed at compile time -- this is true of
    primitive types (`Int32`, `Float64`, etc.) most other concrete types (e.g.
    most
    [structs](https://github.com/josh11b/carbon-lang/blob/structs/docs/design/structs.md)).
-   It could be known generically. This means that it will be known at codegen
    time, but not at type-checking time.
-   It could be dynamic. For example, it could be a
    [dynamic type](#dynamic-pointer-type) such as `Dynamic(TT)`, a
    [variable-sized type](https://github.com/josh11b/carbon-lang/blob/structs/docs/design/structs.md#control-over-allocation),
    or you could dereference a pointer to a base type that could actually point
    to a
    [descendant](https://github.com/josh11b/carbon-lang/blob/structs/docs/design/structs.md#question-extension--inheritance).
-   It could be unknown which category the type is in. In practice this will be
    essentially equivalent to having dynamic size.

I'm going to call a type "sized" if it is in the first two categories, and
"unsized" otherwise. (Note: something with size 0 is still considered "sized".)
The type-type `Sized` is defined as follows:

> `Sized` is a type whose values are types `T` that are "sized" -- that is the
> size of `T` is known, though possibly only generically.

Knowing a type is sized is a precondition to declaring (member/local) variables
of that type, taking values of that type as parameters, returning values of that
type, and defining arrays of that type. There will be other requirements as
well, such as being movable, copyable, or constructible from some types.

Example:

```
interface Foo {
  impl DefaultConstructible;  // See "interface requiring other interfaces".
}
struct Bar {  // Structs are "sized" by default.
  impl Foo;
}
fn F[Foo: T](Ptr(T): x) {  // T is unsized.
  var T: y;  // Illegal: T is unsized.
}
// T is sized, but its size is only known generically.
fn G[Foo + Sized: T](Ptr(T): x) {
  var T: y = *x;  // Allowed: T is sized and default constructible.
}
var Bar: z;
G(&z);  // Allowed: Bar is sized and implements Foo.
```

**Question:** Even if the size is fixed, it won't be known at the time of
compiling the generic function if we are using the dynamic strategy. Should we
automatically [box](#boxed) local variables when using the dynamic strategy? Or
should we only allow `MaybeBox` values to be instantiated locally?

#### Model

This requires a special integer field be included in the witness table type to
hold the size of the type. This field will only be known generically, so if its
value is used for type checking, we need some way of evaluating those type tests
symbolically.

## Dynamic types

Two different goals here:

-   Reducing code size at the expense of more runtime dispatch.
-   Increasing expressivity by allowing types to vary at runtime, AKA
    "[dynamic dispatch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_dispatch)".

We address these two different use cases with two different mechanisms. What
they have in common is using a runtime/dynamic type value (using
`InterfaceName: type_name`, no `$`) instead of a generic type value (using
`InterfaceName:$ type_name`, with a `$`). In the first case,
[we make the type parameter to a function dynamic](#runtime-type-parameters). In
the second case,
[we use a dynamic type value as a field in a struct](#runtime-type-fields). In
both cases, we have a name bound to a runtime type value, which is modeled by a
[dynamic-dispatch witness table](https://github.com/josh11b/carbon-lang/blob/generics-docs/docs/design/generics/terminology.md#dynamic-dispatch-witness-table)
instead of the
[static-dispatch witness table](https://github.com/josh11b/carbon-lang/blob/generics-docs/docs/design/generics/terminology.md#static-dispatch-witness-table)
used with generic type values.

### Runtime type parameters

If we pass in a type as an ordinary parameter (using `:` instead of `:$`), this
means passing the witness table as an ordinary parameter -- that is a
[dynamic-dispatch witness table](https://github.com/josh11b/carbon-lang/blob/generics-docs/docs/design/generics/terminology.md#dynamic-dispatch-witness-table)
-- to the function. This means that there will be a single copy of the generated
code for this parameter.

**Restriction:** The type's size will only be known at runtime, so patterns that
use a type's size such as declaring local variables of that type or passing
values of that type by value are forbidden. Essentially the type is considered
[unsized](#sized-types-and-type-types), even if the type-type is `Sized`.

**Note:** In principle you could imagine supporting values with a dynamic size,
but it would add a large amount of implementation complexity and would not have
the same runtime performance in a way that would likely be surprising to users.
Without a clear value proposition, it seems better just to ask the user to
allocate anything with a dynamic size on the heap using something like
<code>[Boxed](#boxed)</code> below.

**Question:** Should we prevent interfaces that have functions that accept
`Self` parameters or return `Self` values (and therefore violate the unsized
restriction) from being used as the type of runtime type parameters, or should
just those functions be blacklisted?

**Restriction:**
[Rust requires](https://rust-lang.github.io/rfcs/0195-associated-items.html#constraining-associated-types)
all of the type-type's parameters and associated types be specified, since they
can not vary at runtime.

TODO examples

### Runtime type fields

Instead of
[passing in a single type parameter to a function](#runtime-type-parameters), we
could store a type per value. This changes the data layout of the value, and so
is a somewhat more invasive change. It also means that when a function operates
on multiple values they could have different real types, and so
[there are additional restrictions on what functions are supported, like no binary operations](#bookmark=id.3atpcs1p4un9).

**Terminology:** Not quite
["Late binding" on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Late_binding), since
this isn't about looking up names dynamically. It could be called
"[dynamic dispatch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_dispatch)", but that
does not distinguish it from [runtime type parameter](#runtime-type-parameters)
(both use
[dynamic-dispatch witness tables](https://github.com/josh11b/carbon-lang/blob/generics-docs/docs/design/generics/terminology.md#dynamic-dispatch-witness-table))
or normal
[virtual method dispatch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_function).

#### Dynamic pointer type

Given a type-type `TT` (with some restrictions described below), define
`DynPtr(TT)` as a type that can hold a pointer to any value `x` with type `T`
satisfying `TT`. Variables of type `DynPtr(TT)` act like pointers:

-   They do not own what they point to.
-   They have an assignment operator which allows them to point to new values
    (with potentially different types as long as they all satisfy `TT`).
-   They may be copied or moved.
-   They have a fixed size (unlike the values they point to), though that size
    is larger than a regular pointer.

Example:

```
interface Printable {
  method (Ptr(Self): this) Print();
}
struct AnInt {
  var Int: x;
  impl Printable { method (Ptr(Self): this) Print() { PrintInt(this->x); } }
}
struct AString {
  var String: x;
  impl Printable { method (Ptr(Self): this) Print() { PrintString(this->x); } }
}

var AnInt: i = (.x = 3);
var AString: s = (.x = "Hello");

var DynPtr(Printable): i_dynamic = &i;
i_dynamic->Print();  // Prints "3".
var DynPtr(Printable): s_dynamic = &s;
s_dynamic->Print();  // Prints "Hello".

var DynPtr(Printable)[2]: dynamic = (&i, &s);
for (DynPtr(Printable): iter) in dynamic {
  // Prints "3" and then "Hello".
  iter->Print();
}
```

This corresponds to
[a trait object reference in Rust](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch17-02-trait-objects.html).

**Restrictions:** The member functions in the `TT` interface must only have
`Self` in the "receiver" or "this" position.

This is similar to
[the "object safe" restriction in Rust](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/blob/master/text/0255-object-safety.md)
and for the same reasons. Consider an interface that takes `Self` as an
argument:

```
interface EqualCompare {
  method (Ptr(Self): this) IsEqual(Ptr(Self): that) -> Bool;
}
```

and implementations of this interface for our two types:

```
impl EqualCompare for AnInt {
  method (Ptr(AnInt): this) IsEqual(Ptr(AnInt): that) -> Bool {
    return this->x == that->x;
  }
}
impl EqualCompare for AString {
  method (Ptr(AString): this) IsEqual(Ptr(AString): that) -> Bool {
    return this->x == that->x;
  }
}
```

Now given two values of type `Dynamic(EqualCompare)`, what happens if we try and
call `IsEqual`?

```
var DynPtr(EqualCompare): i_dyn_eq = &i;
var DynPtr(EqualCompare): s_dyn_eq = &s;
i_dyn_eq->IsEqual(&*s_dyn_eq);  // Unsound: runtime type confusion
s_dyn_eq->IsEqual(&*i_dyn_eq);  // Unsound: runtime type confusion
```

For `*i_dyn_eq` to implement `EqualCompare.IsEqual`, it needs to accept any
`Ptr(DynPtr(EqualCompare).T)` value for `that`, including `&*s_dyn_eq`. But
`i_dyn_eq->IsEquals(...)` is going to call `AnInt.EqualCompare.IsEqual` which
can only deal with values of type `AnInt`. So this construction is unsound.

Similarly, we can't generally convert a return value using a specific type (like
`AnInt`) into a value using the dynamic type, that has a different
representation.

**Concern:** "object safe" removes one of the expressivity benefits of generics
over inheritance, the ability to use `Self` arguments and return values like
`Compare(Self, Self)` and `Clone(Self) -> Self`. Is this going to be too
restrictive or prevent too many interfaces from being object safe?

Rust has a way of defining some methods only being present in an interface if
there is also a "sized" restriction on the type. Since Rust's trait objects are
not sized, this provides a mechanism for having some methods in the interface
only in situations where you know the type isn't dynamic.

**Context:** See
["Proposal: Fat pointers" section of Carbon: types as function tables, interfaces as type-types (TODO)](#broken-links-footnote)<!-- T:Carbon: types as function tables, interfaces as type-types --><!-- A:#heading=h.t96sqqyjs8xu -->,
[Existential types](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_system#Existential_types)
or
[Dependent pair types](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependent_type'%22%60UNIQ--postMath-00000012-QINU%60%22_type).

##### Model

TODO

```
// Note: InterfaceType is essentially "TypeTypeType".
struct DynPtr(InterfaceType:$$ TT) {  // TT is any interface
  struct DynPtrImpl {
    private TT: t;
    private Ptr(Void): p;  // Really Ptr(t) instead of Ptr(Void).
    impl TT {
      // Defined using meta-programming.
      // Forwards this->F(...) to (this->p as Ptr(this->t))->F(...)
      // or equivalently, this->t.F(this->p as Ptr(this->t), ...).
    }
  }
  var TT:$ T = (DynPtrImpl as TT);
  private DynPtrImpl: impl;
  fn operator->(Ptr(Self): this) -> Ptr(T) { return &this->impl; }
  fn operator=[TT:$ U](Ptr(Self): this, Ptr(U): p) { this->impl = (.t = U, .p = p); }
}
```

#### Deref

To make a function work on either regular or dynamic pointers, we define an
interface `Deref(T)` that both `DynPtr` and `Ptr(T)` implement:

```
// Types implementing `Deref(T)` act like a pointer to `T`.
interface Deref(Type:$ T) {
  // This is used for the `->` and `*` dereferencing operators.
  method (Self: this) Deref() -> Ptr(T);
  impl Copyable;
  impl Movable;
}

// Implementation of Deref() for DynPtr(TT).
extend DynPtr(InterfaceType:$$ TT) {
  impl Deref(DynPtr(TT).DynPtrImpl as TT) { ... }
}
// or equivalently:
extend DynPtr(InterfaceType:$$ TT) {
  impl Deref(DynPtr(TT).T) { ... }
}

// Implementation of Deref(T) for Ptr(T).
extend Ptr(Type:$ T) {
  impl Deref(T) {
    method (Ptr(T): this) Deref() -> Ptr(T) { return this; }
  }
}
```

Now we can implement a function that takes either a regular pointer to a type
implementing `Printable` or a `DynPtr(Printable)`:

```
// This is equivalent to `fn PrintIt[Printable:$ T](T*: x) ...`,
// except it also accepts `DynPtr(Printable)` arguments.
fn PrintIt[Printable:$ T, Deref(T) + Sized: PtrT](PtrT: x) {
  x->Print();
}
PrintIt(&i); // T == (AnInt as Printable), PtrT == T*
// Prints "3"
PrintIt(&s); // T == (AString as Printable), PtrT == T*
// Prints "Hello"
PrintIt(dynamic[0]);  // T == DynPtr(Printable).T, PtrT == DynPtr(Printable)
// Prints "3"
PrintIt(dynamic[1]);  // T == DynPtr(Printable).T, PtrT == DynPtr(Printable)
// Prints "Hello"
```

#### Boxed

One way of dealing with unsized types is via a pointer, as with `T*` and
`DynPtr` above. Sometimes, though, you would like to work with something closer
to value semantics. For example, the `Deref` interface and `DynPtr` type
captures nothing about ownership of the pointed-to value, or how to destroy it.

So we are looking for the equivalent of C++'s `unique_ptr<T>`, that will handle
unsized types, and then later we will add a variation that supports dynamic
types. `Boxed(T)` is like `unique_ptr<T>`:

-   it has a fixed size
-   is movable even if `T` is not
-   will destroy what it points to when it goes out of scope.

It differs, though, in that `Boxed(T)` has an allocator and so can support
copying if `T` does.

```
// Boxed is sized and movable even if T is not.
struct Boxed(Type:$ T,
             // May be able to add more constraints on AllocatorType (like
             // sized & movable) so we could make it a generic argument?
             AllocatorInterface:$$ AllocatorType = DefaultAllocatorType) {
  private var T*: p;
  private var AllocatorType: allocator;
  operator create(T*: p, AllocatorType: allocator = DefaultAllocator) { ... }
  impl Movable { ... }
}

// TODO: Should these just be constructors defined within Boxed(T)?
// If T is constructible from X, then Boxed(T) is constructible from X ...
extend Boxed(ConstructibleFrom(...:$$ Args): T) {
  impl ConstructibleFrom(Args) { ... }
}
// ... and Boxed(X) as well.
extend Boxed(ConstructibleFrom(...:$$ Args): T) {
  impl ConstructibleFrom(Boxed(Args)) { ... }
}

// This allows you to create a Boxed(T) value inferring T so you don't have to
// say it explicitly.
fn Box[Type:$ T](T*: x) -> Boxed(T) { return Boxed(T)(x); }
fn Box[Type:$ T, AllocatorInterface:$$ AllocatorType]
    (T*: x, AllocatorType: allocator) -> Boxed(T, AllocatorType) {
  return Boxed(T, AllocatorType)(x, allocator);
}
```

NOTE: Chandler requests that boxing be explicit so that the cost of indirection
is visible in the source (and in fact visible wherever the dereference happens).
This solution also accomplishes that but may not address all use cases for
boxing.

#### DynBoxed

`DynBoxed(TT)` is to `Boxed(T)` as `DynPtr(TT)` is to `Ptr(T)`. Like
`DynPtr(TT)`, it holds a pointer to a value of any type `T` that satisfies the
interface `TT`. Like `Boxed(T)`, it owns that pointer.

TODO

```
struct DynBoxed(InterfaceType:$$ TT,
                AllocatorInterface:$$ AllocatorType = DefaultAllocatorType) {
  private DynPtr(TT): p;
  private var AllocatorType: allocator;
  ...  // Constructors, etc.
  // Destructor deallocates this->p.
  impl Movable { ... }
}
```

**Question:** Should there be some mechanism to have values be dynboxed in
fast-compile builds, but not boxed in release builds?

**Answer:** Right now we are going with the static strategy for both, and are
just going to focus on making that fast.

#### MaybeBoxed

We have a few different ways of making types with value semantics:

-   `Boxed(T)`: Works with sized and unsized concrete types, `T` need not be
    movable. Even if `T` is movable, it may be large or expensive to move so you
    rather used `Boxed(T)` instead.
-   `DynBoxed(TT)`: Can store values of any type satisfying the interface (so
    definitely unsized). Performs
    [dynamic dispatch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_dispatch).
-   `T`: Regular values that are sized and movable. The extra
    indirection/pointer and heap allocation for putting `T` into a box would
    introduce too much overhead / cost.

In all cases we end up with a sized, movable value that is not very large. Just
like we did with <code>[Deref(T) above](#deref)</code>, we can create an
interface to abstract over the differences, called <code>MaybeBoxed(T)</code>:

```
interface MaybeBoxed(Type:$ T) {
  fn operator->(Ptr(Self): this) -> Ptr(T);
  // plus other smart pointer operators
  impl Movable;
  // We require that MaybeBoxed(T) should be sized, to avoid all
  // users having to say so
  impl Sized;
}

extend Boxed(Type:$ T) {
  impl MaybeBoxed(T {
    fn operator->(Ptr(Self): this) -> Ptr(T) { return this->p; }
  }
}

extend DynBoxed(InterfaceType:$$ TT) {
  impl MaybeBoxed(DynBoxed(TT).T) {
    ...  // TODO
  }
}
```

For the case of values that we can efficiently move without boxing, we implement
a new type `NotBoxed(T)` that adapts `T` and so has the same representation and
supports zero-runtime-cost casting.

```
// Can pass a T to a function accepting a MaybeBoxed(T) value without boxing by
// first casting it to NotBoxed(T), as long as T is sized and movable.
adaptor NotBoxed(Movable + Sized:$ T) for T {  // :$ or :$$ here?
  impl Movable = T as Movable;
  impl MaybeBoxed(T) {
    fn operator->(Ptr(Self): this) -> Ptr(T) { return this as Ptr(T); }
  }
}
// TODO: Should this just be a constructor defined within NotBoxed(T)?
// Says NotBoxed(T) is constructible from a value of type Args if T is.
extend NotBoxed(ConstructibleFrom(...:$$ Args):$ T) {
  impl ConstructibleFrom(Args) { ... }
}

// This allows you to create a NotBoxed(T) value inferring T so you don't have
// to say it explicitly. TODO: Could probably replace "Type:$$ T" with
// "Movable + Sized:$ T", here.
fn DontBox[Type:$$ T](T: x) -> NotBoxed(T) inline { return x as NotBoxed(T); }
// Use NotBoxed as the default implementation of MaybeBoxed for small & movable
// types. TODO: Not sure how to write a size <= 16 bytes constraint here.
extend[Movable + Sized:$$ T] T if (sizeof(T) <= 16) {
  impl MaybBoxed(T) = NotBoxed(T);
}
```

This allows us to write a single generic function using that interface and have
the caller decide which of these mechanisms is the best fit for the specific
types being used.

```
interface Foo { method (Ptr(Self): this) F(); }
fn UseBoxed[Foo:$ T, MaybeBoxed(T):$ BoxType](BoxType: x) {
  x->F();  // Possible indirection is visible
}
struct Bar { impl Foo { ... } }
var DynBoxed(Foo): y = new Bar(...);
UseBoxed(y);
// DontBox might not be needed, if Bar meets the requirements to use the
// default NotBoxed impl of MaybeBox.
UseBoxed(DontBox(Bar()));
```

## Future work

### Abstract return types

This lets you return am anonymous type implementing an interface from a
function.
[Rust has this feature](https://rust-lang.github.io/rfcs/1522-conservative-impl-trait.html).
Also see:

-   [https://rust-lang.github.io/rfcs/1951-expand-impl-trait.html]
-   [https://rust-lang.github.io/rfcs/2071-impl-trait-existential-types.html]
-   [https://rust-lang.github.io/rfcs/2515-type_alias_impl_trait.html]

### Interface defaults

Rust supports specifying defaults for
[interface parameters](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch19-03-advanced-traits.html#default-generic-type-parameters-and-operator-overloading),
[methods](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch10-02-traits.html#default-implementations),
[associated constants](https://doc.rust-lang.org/reference/items/associated-items.html#associated-constants-examples).
We should support this too. It is helpful for evolution, as well as reducing
boilerplate.

In fact, this is a generalization of specialization, as observed
[here](https://rust-lang.github.io/rfcs/1210-impl-specialization.html#default-impls),
as long as we allow more specific implementations to be incomplete and reuse
more general implementations for anything unspecified.

### Operator overloading

TODO: Basically same approach as Rust, implement specific standardized
interfaces for each operator, or family of operators. See
[Rust operator overloading](https://doc.rust-lang.org/rust-by-example/trait/ops.html),
the [Rust ops module](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/ops/index.html), and the
list of
[Rust operators and corresponding traits](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/appendix-02-operators.html#operators).

TODO: should implement one function to get both `==` and `!=`, or another
function to get those plus all comparison operators (`<`, `<=`, `>=`, `>`, and
maybe `<=>`).

TODO: Concern about handling `a + b` and `b + a` in both mixed and same types
cases. See
[the discussion in this doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1YjF1jcXCSb4zQ4kCcZFAK5jtbIJh9IdaaTbzmQEwSNg/edit#heading=h.unhb6k4e2tps).

Rust added defaults for trait parameters for this use case, see
[Default Generic Type Parameters and Operator Overloading](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch19-03-advanced-traits.html#default-generic-type-parameters-and-operator-overloading)

### Impls with state

Impls where the impl itself has state. (from richardsmith@) Use case:
implementing interfaces for a flyweight in a Flyweight pattern where the Impl
needs a reference to a key -> info map.

### Generic associated types

TODO: Used for "property maps" in the Boost.Graph library.

See
[Carbon generics use case: graph library](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xk0GLtpBl2OOnf3F_6Z-A3DtTt-r7wdOZ5wPipYUSO0/edit?usp=sharing&resourcekey=0-mBSmwn6b6jwbLaQw2WG6OA)
for context.

Rust has been working toward adding this feature
([1](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/44265),
[2](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/blob/master/text/1598-generic_associated_types.md),
[3](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1598),
[4](https://www.fpcomplete.com/blog/monads-gats-nightly-rust/)). It has been
proposed for Swift as well
([1](https://forums.swift.org/t/idea-generic-associated-types/5422),
[2](https://forums.swift.org/t/generic-associated-type/17831)). This corresponds
roughly to
[member templates in C++](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/member_template).

### Higher-ranked types

A solution to the problem posed
[here (TODO)](#broken-links-footnote)<!-- T:Carbon: types as function tables, interfaces as type-types --><!-- A:#heading=h.qvhzlz54obmt -->,
where we need a representation for a way to go from a type to an implementation
of an interface parameterized by that type. Examples of things we might want to
express:

-   This priority queue's second argument (`QueueLike`) is a function that takes
    a type `U` and returns a type that implements `QueueInterface(U)`:

```
struct PriorityQueue(
    Type:$ T, fn (Type:$ U)->QueueInterface(U):$ QueueLike) {
  ...
}
```

-   Map takes a container of type `T` and function from `T` to `V` into a
    container of type `V`:

```
fn Map[Type:$ T,
       fn (Type:$ U)->StackInterface(U):$ StackLike,
       Type:$ V]
    (Ptr(StackLike(T)): x, fn (T)->V: f) -> StackLike(V) { ... }
```

TODO: Challenging! Probably needs something like
[Dependent function types](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependent_type#Pi_type)

Generic associated types and higher-ranked (or is it higher-kinded?) types solve
the same problem in two different contexts. Generic associated types are about
members of interfaces and higher-ranked types are about function parameters.

Swift proposals:
[1](https://forums.swift.org/t/higher-kinded-types-monads-functors-etc/4691),
[2](https://forums.swift.org/t/proposal-higher-kinded-types-monads-functors-etc/559),
[3](https://github.com/typelift/swift/issues/1). These correspond roughly to
[C++ template template parameters](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/template_parameters#Template_template_parameter).

## Index of examples

Specifically, how does this proposal address
[the use cases from the "problem statement" doc](https://github.com/josh11b/carbon-lang/blob/generics-docs/docs/design/generics/use-cases.md)?

-   Define an
    [interface](https://github.com/josh11b/carbon-lang/blob/generics-docs/docs/design/generics/terminology.md#interface).
    -   [in "Interfaces" section](#interfaces) (and most other sections).
-   Define an interface with
    [type parameters](https://github.com/josh11b/carbon-lang/blob/generics-docs/docs/design/generics/terminology.md#interface-type-parameters-vs-associated-types)
    (maybe) and/or
    [associated types](https://github.com/josh11b/carbon-lang/blob/generics-docs/docs/design/generics/terminology.md#interface-type-parameters-vs-associated-types)
    (almost certainly).
    -   [associated types](#associated-types),
    -   [type parameters](#parameterized-interfaces).
-   Define an interface with
    [type constraints](https://github.com/josh11b/carbon-lang/blob/generics-docs/docs/design/generics/terminology.md#type-constraints),
    such as associated types or type parameters satisfying some interface. Type
    constraints will also be needed as part of generic function definitions, to
    define relationships between type parameters and associated types.
    -   [associated types](#bookmark=id.y76bpmnyjm7k),
    -   [type parameters](#bookmark=id.arne8eq43vmm).
-   Optional, but probably straightforward if we want it: Define an interface
    that
    [extends/refines](https://github.com/josh11b/carbon-lang/blob/generics-docs/docs/design/generics/terminology.md#extendingrefining-an-interface)
    another interface:
    -   [interface extension](#interface-extension).
-   Similarly we probably want a way to say an interface requires an
    implementation of one or more other interfaces:
    -   [interface requiring other interfaces](#interface-requiring-other-interfaces)
-   Define how a type
    [implements](https://github.com/josh11b/carbon-lang/blob/generics-docs/docs/design/generics/terminology.md#impls-implementations-of-interfaces)
    an interface
    ([semantic conformance](https://github.com/josh11b/carbon-lang/blob/generics-docs/docs/design/generics/terminology.md#semantic-vs-structural-interfaces)).

    -   [implementing interfaces](#implementing-interfaces)

    It should address
    [the expression problem](https://eli.thegreenplace.net/2016/the-expression-problem-and-its-solutions),
    e.g. by allowing the impl definition to be completely separate as long as it
    is defined with either the type or the interface.

    -   [External impl](#external-impl)
    -   [Impl lookup](#impl-lookup-and-specialization)

-   Define a parameterized implementation of an interface for a family of types.
    This is both for
    [structural conformance](https://github.com/josh11b/carbon-lang/blob/generics-docs/docs/design/generics/terminology.md#semantic-vs-structural-interfaces)
    via
    [templated impls](https://github.com/josh11b/carbon-lang/blob/generics-docs/docs/design/generics/terminology.md#templated-impl),
    and
    [conditional conformance](https://github.com/josh11b/carbon-lang/blob/generics-docs/docs/design/generics/terminology.md#conditional-conformance).
    That family of types may have generic or regular parameters, so that e.g.
    you could implement a `Printable` interface for arrays of `N` elements of
    `Printable` type `T`, generically for `N` (not separately instantiated for
    each `N`).
    -   [Conditional conformance](#conditional-conformance)
    -   [Templated impls for structural conformance](#templated-impls-for-generic-interfaces)
        (TODO)
-   Control how an interface may be used in order to reserve or abandon rights
    to evolve the interface. See
    [the relevant open question in "Carbon closed function overloading proposal" (TODO)](#broken-links-footnote)<!-- T:Carbon closed function overloading proposal --><!-- A:#bookmark=id.hxvlthy3z3g1 -->.
    -   TODO
-   Specify a generic explicit (non-type or type) argument to a function:
    -   [Example: Multiple implementations of the same interface](#example-multiple-implementations-of-the-same-interface)..
-   Specify a generic
    [implicit argument](https://github.com/josh11b/carbon-lang/blob/generics-docs/docs/design/generics/terminology.md#implicit-argument)
    to a function:
    -   ["generics" section](#generics).
-   Specify a generic type argument constrained to conform to an interface. And
    in the function, call methods defined in the the interface on a value of
    that type.
    -   ["generics" section](#generics),
    -   [Example: Multiple implementations of the same interface](#example-multiple-implementations-of-the-same-interface).
-   Specify a generic type argument constrained to conform to multiple
    interfaces. And in the function, call methods defined in each interface on a
    value of that type, and pass the value to functions expecting any subset of
    those interfaces. Ideally this would be convenient enough that we could
    favor fewer narrow interfaces and combine them instead of having a large
    number of wide interfaces.
    -   [Combining interfaces by adding type-types](#combining-interfaces-by-adding-type-types)
-   Define multiple implementations of an interface for a single type, be able
    to pass those multiple implementations in a single function call, and have
    the function body be able to control which implementation is used when
    calling interface methods. This should work for any interface, without
    requiring cooperation from the interface definition. For example, have a
    function sort songs by artist, then by album, and then by title given those
    three orderings separately.
    -   [Example: Multiple implementations of the same interface](#example-multiple-implementations-of-the-same-interface).
-   In general, ways of specifying new combinations of interface implementations
    for a type. For example, a way to call a generic function with a value of
    some type, even if the interface and type are defined in different libraries
    unknown to each other, by providing an implementation for that interface in
    some way. This problem is described in
    "[The trouble with typeclasses](https://pchiusano.github.io/2018-02-13/typeclasses.html)".
    -   [Adapting types](#adapting-types).
-   A value with a type implementing a superset of the interfaces required by a
    generic function may be passed to the function without additional syntax
    beyond passing the same value to a non-generic function expecting the exact
    type of the value
    ([subsumption](https://github.com/josh11b/carbon-lang/blob/generics-docs/docs/design/generics/terminology.md#subsumption-and-casting)).
    This should be true for values with types only known generically, as long as
    it is generically known that the type implements a sufficient set of
    interfaces.
    -   [Subsumption](#subsumption)
-   Define a parameterized entity (such as a function) such that code for it
    will only be generated once.
    -   [Runtime type parameters](#runtime-type-parameters)
-   Define a parameterized entity such that code for it will be generated
    separately for each distinct combination of arguments.
    -   [Generics](#generics)
-   Convert values of arbitrary types implementing an interface into values of a
    single type that implements that same interface, for a sufficiently
    well-behaved interface.
    -   [Runtime type fields](#runtime-type-fields)

Stretch goals:

-   A way to define one or a few functions and get an implementation for an
    interface that has more functions (like defining `<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=`, `==`,
    and `!=` in terms of `<=>`, or `++`, `--`, `+`, `-`, and `-=` from `+=`).
    Possibly the "one or few functions" won't even be part of the interface.
    -   [Example: Defining an impl for use by other types](#example-defining-an-impl-for-use-by-other-types)
-   Define an interface implementation algorithmically -- possibly via a
    function returning an impl, or by defining an
    [adapting type](https://github.com/josh11b/carbon-lang/blob/generics-docs/docs/design/generics/terminology.md#adapting-a-type)
    that implements that interface. This could be a solution to the previous
    bullet. Another use case is when there are few standard implementation
    strategies for an interface, and you want to provide those implementations
    in a way that makes it easy for new types to adopt one.
    -   [Example: Defining an impl for use by other types](#example-defining-an-impl-for-use-by-other-types)
-   Support a way to switch between algorithms based on the capabilities of a
    type. For example, we may want to use different algorithms for random-access
    vs. bidirectional iterators. Similarly, a way to have specialization based
    on type information in a generic like you might do in a template function
    for performance but still would allow type checking. Example: In C++,
    `std::vector<T>::resize()` can use a more efficient algorithm if `T` has a
    `noexcept` move constructor. Can this optimization be allowed from generic
    code since it does not affect the signature of `resize()`, and therefore
    type checking? In a non-release build, it would be semantically equivalent
    but slower to ignore the optimized implementation.
    -   [Use case: overload resolution](#use-case-overload-resolution)
-   As much as possible, switching a templated function to a generic one should
    involve minimal changes to the function body. It should primarily just
    consist of adding constraints to the signature. When changes are needed, the
    compiler will not accept the code without them. No semantics of any code
    will change merely as the result of switching from template to generics. See
    ["Carbon principle: Generics"](https://github.com/josh11b/carbon-lang/blob/principle-generics/docs/project/principles/principle-generics.md).
    -   No semantic changes to code when switching from template -> generic.
    -   [Interfaces implemented inline contribute to the type's API](#implementing-interfaces)
    -   Only changes needed are when using [external impl](#external-impl), or
        [resolving name conflicts between interfaces](#combining-interfaces-by-adding-type-types)
        using [qualified member names](#qualified-member-names). Code will not
        compile without those changes.
    -   No change to function body code going from generic -> template.

Very stretch goals (these are more difficult, and possibly optional):

-   Define an interface where the relationship between the input and output
    types is a little complicated. For example, widening multiplication from an
    integer type to one with more bits, or
    `Abs: Complex(SomeIntType) -> SomeFloatType`. One possible strategy is to
    have the return type be represented by an
    [associated type](https://github.com/josh11b/carbon-lang/blob/generics-docs/docs/design/generics/terminology.md#interface-type-parameters-vs-associated-types).
    -   [Constraints on associated types in interfaces](#constraints-on-associated-types-in-interfaces)
-   Define an interface that has multiple related types, like Graph/Nodes/Edges.
    TODO: A concrete combination of `Graph`, `Edge`, and `Node` types that we
    would like to define an interface for. Is the problem when you `Edge` and
    `Node` refer to each other, so you need a forward declaration to break the
    cycle?

    Impl needs a reference to a key -> info map.

    -   TODO: Challenging! Probably needs something like [Dependent function types](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependent_type#Pi_type)

to predict how to do these things, how to compose these things, and what
expressions are legal.

    throughout the doc

## Notes

These are notes from discussions after this document was first written that have
not yet been incorporated into the main text above.

-   Can use IDE tooling to show all methods including external impl,
    automatically switching to [qualified member names](#qualified-member-names)
    where needed to get that method.
-   "Functional dependencies" in Haskell about the unique/generic vs.
    non-unique/template arguments distinction for type parameters of interfaces
-   Open question: is it okay for interface definer to decide (a) whether type
    used in constraints, (b) whether different parameters make different
    interfaces that a type can implement multiple of.
-   Example: what is the type of the subsequence of a sequence, from Dmitri
-   Imagine I want to define a new interface that has the type implements
    property but also implements a new method.
-   Static/type fields holding non-type values: Should have these, should not
    have distinction between types/functions/other types.
-   Instance fields: capabilities include read, write, address-of (implies read
    & write?). Swift also has a modify capability implemented using coroutines.
    If we have address-of, it must be a real address.
-   Question: C++ maybe gets wrong that you can take address of any member.
    Greatly simplifies sanitizers, makes reasoning about what side effects can
    affect members for correctness easier. Maybe opt-in feature? Similarly for
    local variables. Maybe can call function taking a pointer from a member
    function as long as it doesn't capture? Need to firm up design for instance
    fields before interfaces for instance fields.
-   Concern about interfaces for operator overloading: Point + Vector = Point,
    Point - Point = Vector
-   Concern about type-type model: adds friction to binary operators -- is left
    or right type is self? Couple of problems with the idea of interface
    implemented for the (LeftType, RightType) tuple. How does the impl get
    passed in? How do you say that an interface is only for pairs?
-   Use case problem: Have interface `MultipliesBy(R)` for Self \* R. Want to
    write a constraint that a function can take any `R` type such that type
    `Foo` implements `MultipliesBy(R)`.
-   Want inheritance with virtual functions to be modeled by interface
    extension. Example showing the interaction between Dynamic pointer types and
    interface extension.

How do we represent binary operations like `Addable`? Could the interface be
defined on the pair of types of the two arguments somehow?

```
fn F(A: a, B: b, ..., Addable(A, B):$ T) requires (A,B) : Addable(A, B) {
  ((A, B) as T).DoTheAdd(x, y)
}
```
