## Overview

This document goes into the details of the design of generic type parameters.

Imagine we want to write a function parameterized by a type argument. Maybe our
function is `PrintToStdout` and let's say we want to operate on values that have
a type for which we have an implementation of the `ConvertibleToString`
interface. The `ConvertibleToString` interface has a `ToString` method returning
a string. To do this, we give the `PrintToStdout` function two parameters: one
is the value to print, let's call that `val`, the other is the type of that
value, let's call that `T`. The type of `val` is `T`, what is the type of `T`?
Well, since we want to let `T` be any type implementing the
`ConvertibleToString` interface, we express that in the "interfaces are
type-of-types" model by saying the type of `T` is `ConvertibleToString`.

Since we can figure out `T` from the type of `val`, we don't need the caller to
pass in `T` explicitly, so it can be an
[deduced argument](terminology.md#deduced-parameter) (also see
[deduced argument](overview.md#deduced-parameters) in the Generics overview
doc). Basically, the user passes in a value for `val`, and the type of `val`
determines `T`. `T` still gets passed into the function though, and it plays an
important role -- it defines the implementation of the interface. We can think
of the interface as defining a struct type whose members are function pointers,
and an implementation of an interface as a value of that struct with actual
function pointer values. So an implementation is a table of function pointers
(one per function defined in the interface) that gets passed into a function as
the type argument. For more on this, see [the model section](#model) below.

In addition to function pointer members, interfaces can include any constants
that belong to a type. For example, the
[type's size](#sized-types-and-type-of-types) (represented by an integer
constant member of the type) could be a member of an interface and its
implementation. There are a few cases why we would include another interface
implementation as a member:

-   [associated types](#associated-types)
-   [type parameters](#parameterized-interfaces)
-   [interface requirements](#interface-requiring-other-interfaces)

The function can decide whether that type argument is passed in
[statically](terminology.md#static-dispatch-witness-table) (basically generating
a separate function body for every different type passed in) by using the
"generic argument" syntax (`:!`, see [the generics section](#generics) below) or
[dynamically](terminology.md#dynamic-dispatch-witness-table) using the regular
argument syntax (just a colon, `:`, see
[the runtime type parameters section](#runtime-type-parameters) below). Either
way, the interface contains enough information to
[type and definition check](terminology.md#complete-definition-checking) the
function body -- you can only call functions defined in the interface in the
function body. Contrast this with making the type a template argument, where you
could just use `Type` instead of an interface and it will work as long as the
function is only called with types that allow the definition of the function to
compile. The interface bound has other benefits:

-   allows the compiler to deliver clearer error messages,
-   documents expectations, and
-   expresses that a type has certain semantics beyond what is captured in its
    member function names and signatures.

The last piece of the puzzle is how the caller of the function can produce a
value with the right type. Let's say the user has a value of type `Song`, and of
course songs have all sorts of functionality. If we want a `Song` to be printed
using the `PrintToStdout` function, it needs to implement the
`ConvertibleToString` interface. Note that we _don't_ say that `Song` is of type
`ConvertibleToString` but instead that it has a "facet type". This means there
is another type, called `Song as ConvertibleToString`, with the following
properties:

-   `Song as ConvertibleToString` has the same _data representation_ as `Song`.
-   `Song as ConvertibleToString` is an implementation of the interface
    `ConvertibleToString`. The functions of `Song as ConvertibleToString` are
    just implementations of the names and signatures defined in the
    `ConvertibleToString` interface, like `ToString`, and not the functions
    defined on `Song` values.
-   Carbon will implicitly cast values from type `Song` to type
    `Song as ConvertibleToString` when calling a function that can only accept
    types of type `ConvertibleToString`.
-   In the normal case where the implementation of `ConvertibleToString` for
    `Song` is not defined as `external`, every member of
    `Song as ConvertibleToString` is also a member of `Song`. This includes
    members of `ConvertibleToString` that are not explicitly named in the `impl`
    definition but have defaults.
-   You may access the `ToString` function for a `Song` value `w` by writing a
    _qualified_ function call, like `w.(ConvertibleToString.ToString)()`. The
    same effect may be achieved by casting, as in
    `(w as (Song as ConvertibleToString)).ToString()`. This qualified syntax is
    available whether or not the implementation is defined as `external`.
-   If other interfaces are implemented for `Song`, they are also implemented
    for `Song as ConvertibleToString`. The only thing that changes when casting
    a `Song` `w` to `Song as ConvertibleToString` are the names that are
    accessible without using the qualification syntax. A
    `Song as ConvertibleToString` value can likewise be cast to a `Song`; a
    `Song` acts just like another facet type for these purposes.

We define these facet types (alternatively, interface implementations) either
with the type, with the interface, or somewhere else where Carbon can be
guaranteed to see when needed. For more on this, see
[the implementing interfaces section](#implementing-interfaces) below.

If `Song` doesn't implement an interface or we would like to use a different
implementation of that interface, we can define another type that also has the
same data representation as `Song` that has whatever different interface
implementations we want. However, Carbon won't implicitly cast to that other
type, the user will have to explicitly cast to that type in order to select
those alternate implementations. For more on this, see
[the adapting type section](#adapting-types) below.

## Interfaces

An [interface](terminology.md#interface), defines an API that a given type can
implement. For example, an interface capturing a linear-algebra vector API might
have two methods:

```
interface Vector {
  // Here "Self" means "the type implementing this interface".
  fn Add[me: Self](b: Self) -> Self;
  fn Scale[me: Self](v: Double) -> Self;
}
```

The syntax here is to match
[how the same members would be defined in a type](/docs/design/classes.md#methods).
Each declaration in the interface defines an
[associated entity](terminology.md#associated-entity). In this example, `Vector`
has two associated methods, `Add` and `Scale`.

An interface defines a type-of-type, that is a type whose values are types. The
values of an interface are specifically
[facet types](terminology.md#facet-type), by which we mean types that are
declared as specifically implementing **exactly** this interface, and which
provide definitions for all the functions (and other members) declared in the
interface.

## Implementing interfaces

Carbon interfaces are ["nominal"](terminology.md#nominal-interfaces), which
means that types explicitly describe how they implement interfaces. An
["impl"](terminology.md#impls-implementations-of-interfaces) defines how one
interface is implemented for a type. Every associated entity is given a
definition. Different types satisfying `Vector` can have different definitions
for `Add` and `Scale`, so we say their definitions are _associated_ with what
type is implementing `Vector`. The `impl` defines what is associated with the
type for that interface.

Impls may be defined inline inside the type definition:

```
class Point {
  var x: Double;
  var y: Double;
  impl as Vector {
    // In this scope, "Self" is an alias for "Point".
    fn Add[me: Self](b: Self) -> Self {
      return Point(.x = a.x + b.x, .y = a.y + b.y);
    }
    fn Scale[me: Self](v: Double) -> Self {
      return Point(.x = a.x * v, .y = a.y * v);
    }
  }
}
```

Interfaces that are implemented inline contribute to the type's API:

```
var p1: Point = (.x = 1.0, .y = 2.0);
var p2: Point = (.x = 2.0, .y = 4.0);
Assert(p1.Scale(2.0) == p2);
Assert(p1.Add(p1) == p2);
```

**Comparison with other languages:** Rust defines implementations lexically
outside of the `class` definition. This Carbon approach means that a type's API
is described by declarations inside the `class` definition and doesn't change
afterwards.

**References:** This interface implementation syntax was accepted in
[proposal #553](https://github.com/carbon-language/carbon-lang/pull/553). In
particular, see
[the alternatives considered](/proposals/p0553.md#interface-implementation-syntax).

### Facet type

The `impl` definition defines a [facet type](terminology.md#facet-type):
`Point as Vector`. While the API of `Point` includes the two fields `x` and `y`
along with the `Add` and `Scale` methods, the API of `Point as Vector` _only_
has the `Add` and `Scale` methods of the `Vector` interface. The facet type
`Point as Vector` is [compatible](terminology.md#compatible-types) with `Point`,
meaning their data representations are the same, so we allow you to cast between
the two freely:

```
var a: Point = (.x = 1.0, .y = 2.0);
// `a` has `Add` and `Scale` methods:
a.Add(a.Scale(2.0));

// Cast from Point implicitly
var b: Point as Vector = a;
// `b` has `Add` and `Scale` methods:
b.Add(b.Scale(2.0));

// Will also implicitly cast when calling functions:
fn F(c: Point as Vector, d: Point) {
  d.Add(c.Scale(2.0));
}
F(a, b);

// Explicit casts
var z: Point as Vector = (a as (Point as Vector)).Scale(3.0);
z.Add(b);
var w: Point = z as Point;
```

These [casts](terminology.md#subtyping-and-casting) change which names are
exposed in the type's API, but as much as possible we don't want the meaning of
any given name to change. Instead we want these casts to simply change the
subset of names that are visible.

**Note:** In general the above is written assuming that casts are written
"`a as T`" where `a` is a value and `T` is the type to cast to. When we write
`Point as Vector`, the value `Point` is a type, and `Vector` is a type of a
type, or a "type-of-type".

**Note:** A type may implement any number of different interfaces, but may
provide at most one implementation of any single interface. This makes the act
of selecting an implementation of an interface for a type unambiguous throughout
the whole program, so for example `Point as Vector` is well defined.

We don't expect users to ordinarily name facet types explicitly in source code.
Instead, values are implicitly cast to a facet type as part of calling a generic
function, as described in the [Generics](#generics) section.

### Implementing multiple interfaces

To implement more than one interface when defining a type, simply include an
`impl` block per interface.

```
class Point {
  var x: Double;
  var y: Double;
  impl as Vector {
    fn Add[me: Self](b: Self) -> Self { ... }
    fn Scale[me: Self](v: Double) -> Self { ... }
  }
  impl as Drawable {
    fn Draw[me: Self]() { ... }
  }
}
```

In this case, all the functions `Add`, `Scale`, and `Draw` end up a part of the
API for `Point`. This means you can't implement two interfaces that have a name
in common (unless you use an `external impl` for one or both, as described
below).

```
class GameBoard {
  impl as Drawable {
    fn Draw[me: Self]() { ... }
  }
  impl as EndOfGame {
    // ❌ Error: `GameBoard` has two methods named
    // `Draw` with the same signature.
    fn Draw[me: Self]() { ... }
    fn Winner[me: Self](player: Int) { ... }
  }
}
```

**Open question:** Should we have some syntax for the case where you want both
names to be given the same implementation? It seems like that might be a common
case, but we won't really know if this is an important case until we get more
experience.

```
class Player {
  var name: String;
  impl as Icon {
    fn Name[me: Self]() -> String { return this.name; }
    // ...
  }
  impl as GameUnit {
    // Possible syntax for defining `GameUnit.Name` as
    // the same as `Icon.Name`:
    alias Name = Icon.Name;
    // ...
  }
}
```

### External impl

Interfaces may also be implemented for a type externally, by using the
`external impl` construct which takes the name of an existing type:

```
class Point2 {
  var x: Double;
  var y: Double;
}

external impl Point2 as Vector {
  // In this scope, "Self" is an alias for "Point2".
  fn Add[me: Self](b: Self) -> Self {
    return Point2(.x = a.x + b.x, .y = a.y + b.y);
  }
  fn Scale[me: Self](v: Double) -> Self {
    return Point2(.x = a.x * v, .y = a.y * v);
  }
}
```

**References:** The external interface implementation syntax was decided in
[proposal #553](https://github.com/carbon-language/carbon-lang/pull/553). In
particular, see
[the alternatives considered](/proposals/p0553.md#interface-implementation-syntax).

The `external impl` statement is allowed to be defined in a different library
from `Point2`, restricted by [the coherence/orphan rules](#impl-lookup) that
ensure that the implementation of an interface won't change based on imports. In
particular, the `external impl` statement is allowed in the library defining the
interface (`Vector` in this case) in addition to the library that defines the
type (`Point2` here). This (at least partially) addresses
[the expression problem](https://eli.thegreenplace.net/2016/the-expression-problem-and-its-solutions).

We don't want the API of `Point2` to change based on what is imported though. So
the `external impl` statement does not add the interface's methods to the type.
It would be particularly bad if two different libraries implemented interfaces
with conflicting names both affected the API of a single type. The result is you
can find all the names of direct (unqualified) members of a type in the
definition of that type. The only thing that may be in another library is an
`impl` of an interface.

On the other hand, if we cast to the facet type, those methods do become
visible:

```
var a: Point2 = (.x = 1.0, .y = 2.0);
// `a` does *not* have `Add` and `Scale` methods:
// ❌ Error: a.Add(a.Scale(2.0));

// Cast from Point2 implicitly
var b: Point2 as Vector = a;
// `b` does have `Add` and `Scale` methods:
b.Add(b.Scale(2.0));

fn F(c: Point2 as Vector) {
  // Can call `Add` and `Scale` on `c` even though we can't on `a`.
  c.Add(c.Scale(2.0));
}
F(a);
```

You might intentionally use `external impl` to implement an interface for a type
to avoid cluttering the API of that type, for example to avoid a name collision.
A syntax for reusing method implementations allows us to do this selectively
when needed:

```
class Point3 {
  var x: Double;
  var y: Double;
  fn Add[me: Self](b: Self) -> Self {
    return Point3(.x = a.x + b.x, .y = a.y + b.y);
  }
}

external Point3 as Vector {
  alias Add = Point3.Add;  // Syntax TBD
  fn Scale[me: Self](v: Double) -> Self {
    return Point3(.x = a.x * v, .y = a.y * v);
  }
}
```

With this definition, `Point3` includes `Add` in its API but not `Scale`, while
`Point3 as Vector` includes both. This maintains the property that you can
determine the API of a type by looking at its definition.

**Rejected alternative:** We could allow types to have different APIs in
different files based on explicit configuration in that file. For example, we
could support a declaration that a given interface or a given method of an
interface is "in scope" for a particular type in this file. With that
declaration, the method could be called unqualified. This avoids most concerns
arising from name collisions between interfaces. It has a few downsides though:

-   It increases variability between files, since the same type will have
    different APIs depending on these declarations. This makes it harder to
    copy-paste code between files.
-   It makes reading code harder, since you have to search the file for these
    declarations that affect name lookup.

**Comparison with other languages:** Both Rust and Swift support external
implementation.
[Swift's syntax](https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/LanguageGuide/Protocols.html#ID277)
does this as an "extension" of the original type. In Rust, all implementations
are external as in
[this example](https://doc.rust-lang.org/rust-by-example/trait.html). Unlike
Swift and Rust, we don't allow a type's API to be modified outside its
definition. So in Carbon a type's API is consistent no matter what is imported,
unlike Swift and Rust.

### Qualified member names

Given a value of type `Point2` and an interface `Vector` implemented for that
type, you can access the methods from that interface using the member's
_qualified name_, whether or not the implementation is done externally with an
`external impl` statement:

```
var p1: Point2 = (.x = 1.0, .y = 2.0);
var p2: Point2 = (.x = 2.0, .y = 4.0);
Assert(p1.(Vector.Scale)(2.0) == p2);
Assert(p1.(Vector.Add)(p1) == p2);
```

Note that the name in the parens is looked up in the containing scope, not in
the names of members of `Point2`. So if there was another interface `Drawable`
with method `Draw` defined in the `Plot` package also implemented for `Point2`,
as in:

```
package Plot;
import Points;

interface Drawable {
  fn Draw[me: Self]();
}

external impl Points.Point2 as Drawable { ... }
```

You could access `Draw` with a qualified name:

```
import Plot;
import Points;

var p: Points.Point2 = (.x = 1.0, .y = 2.0);
p.(Plot.Drawable.Draw)();
```

**Comparison with other languages:** This is intended to be analogous to, in
C++, adding `ClassName::` in front of a member name to disambiguate, such as
[names defined in both a parent and child class](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/357307/how-to-call-a-parent-class-function-from-derived-class-function).

## Generics

Now let us write a function that can accept values of any type that has
implemented the `Vector` interface:

```
fn AddAndScaleGeneric[T:! Vector](a: T, b: T, s: Double) -> T {
  return a.Add(b).Scale(s);
}
var v: Point = AddAndScaleGeneric(a, w, 2.5);
```

Here `T` is a type whose type is `Vector`. The `:!` syntax means that `T` is a
_[generic parameter](terminology.md#generic-versus-template-parameters)_, that
is it must be known to the caller but we will only use the information present
in the signature of the function to typecheck the body of `AddAndScaleGeneric`'s
definition. In this case, we know that any value of type `T` implements the
`Vector` interface and so has an `Add` and a `Scale` method.

When we call `AddAndScaleGeneric`, we need to determine the value of `T` to use
when passed values with type `Point`. Since `T` has type `Vector`, the compiler
simply sets `T` to `Point as Vector`. This
[cast](terminology.md#subtyping-and-casting)
[erases](terminology.md#type-erasure) all of the API of `Point` and substitutes
the api of `Vector`, without changing anything about the data representation. It
acts like we called this non-generic function, found by setting `T` to
`Point as Vector`:

```
fn AddAndScaleForPointAsVector(
      a: Point as Vector, b: Point as Vector, s: Double)
      -> Point as Vector {
  return a.Add(b).Scale(s);
}
// May still be called with Point arguments, due to implicit casts.
// Similarly the return value can be implicitly cast to a Point.
var v2: Point = AddAndScaleForPointAsVector(a, w, 2.5);
```

Since `Point` implements `Vector` inline, `Point` also has definitions for `Add`
and `Scale`:

```
fn AddAndScaleForPoint(a: Point, b: Point, s: Double) -> Point {
  return a.Add(b).Scale(s);
}

AddAndScaleForPoint(a, w, 2.5);
```

However, for another type implementing `Vector` but out-of-line using an
`external impl` statement, such as `Point2`, the situation is different:

```
fn AddAndScaleForPoint2(a: Point2, b: Point2, s: Double) -> Point2 {
  // ❌ ERROR: `Point2` doesn't have `Add` or `Scale` methods.
  return a.Add(b).Scale(s);
}
```

Even though `Point2` doesn't have `Add` and `Scale` methods, it still implements
`Vector` and so can still call `AddAndScaleGeneric`:

```
var a2: Point2 = (.x = 1.0, .y = 2.0);
var w2: Point2 = (.x = 3.0, .y = 4.0);
var v3: Point2 = AddAndScaleGeneric(a, w, 2.5);
```

**References:** The `:!` syntax was accepted in
[proposal #676](https://github.com/carbon-language/carbon-lang/pull/676).

### Model

The underlying model here is interfaces are
[type-of-types](terminology.md#type-of-type), in particular, the type of
[facet types](terminology.md#facet-type):

-   [Interfaces](#interfaces) are types of
    [witness tables](terminology.md#witness-tables)
-   Facet types (defined by [Impls](#implementing-interfaces)) are
    [witness table](terminology.md#witness-tables) values
-   The compiler rewrites functions with an implicit type argument
    (`fn Foo[InterfaceName:! T](...)`) to have an actual argument with type
    determined by the interface, and supplied at the callsite using a value
    determined by the impl.

For the example above, [the Vector interface](#interfaces) could be thought of
defining a witness table type like:

```
class Vector {
  // Self is the representation type, which is only
  // known at compile time.
  var Self:! Type;
  // `fnty` is **placeholder** syntax for a "function type",
  // so `Add` is a function that takes two `Self` parameters
  // and returns a value of type `Self`.
  var Add: fnty(a: Self, b: Self) -> Self;
  var Scale: fnty(a: Self, v: Double) -> Self;
}
```

The [impl of Vector for Point](#implementing-interfaces) would be a value of
this type:

```
var VectorForPoint: Vector  = {
    .Self = Point,
    // `lambda` is **placeholder** syntax for defining a
    // function value.
    .Add = lambda(a: Point, b: Point) -> Point {
      return Point(.x = a.x + b.x, .y = a.y + b.y);
    },
    .Scale = lambda(a: Point, v: Double) -> Point {
      return Point(.x = a.x * v, .y = a.y * v);
    },
};
```

Finally we can define a generic function and call it, like
[`AddAndScaleGeneric` from the "Generics" section](#generics) by making the
witness table an explicit argument to the function:

```
fn AddAndScaleGeneric
    (t:! Vector, a: t.Self, b: t.Self, s: Double) -> t.Self {
  return t.Scale(t.Add(a, b), s);
}
// Point implements Vector.
var v: Point = AddAndScaleGeneric(VectorForPoint, a, w, 2.5);
```

The rule is that generic arguments (declared using `:!`) are passed at compile
time, so the actual value of the `t` argument here can be used to generate the
code for `AddAndScaleGeneric`. So `AddAndScaleGeneric` is using a
[static-dispatch witness table](terminology.md#static-dispatch-witness-table).

## Interfaces recap

Interfaces have a name and a definition.

The definition of an interface consists of a set of declarations. Each
declaration defines a requirement for any `impl` that is in turn a capability
that consumers of that `impl` can rely on. Typically those declarations also
have names, useful for both saying how the `impl` satisfies the requirement and
accessing the capability.

Interfaces are ["nominal"](terminology.md#nominal-interfaces), which means their
name is significant. So two interfaces with the same body definition but
different names are different, just like two classes with the same definition
but different names are considered different types. For example, lets say we
define another interface, say `LegoFish`, with the same `Add` and `Scale` method
signatures. Implementing `Vector` would not imply an implementation of
`LegoFish`, because the `impl` definition explicitly refers to the name
`Vector`.

An interface's name may be used in a few different contexts:

-   to define [an `impl` for a type](#implementing-interfaces),
-   as a namespace name in [a qualified name](#qualified-member-names), and
-   as a [type-of-type](terminology.md#type-of-type) for
    [a generic type parameter](#generics).

While interfaces are examples of type-of-types, type-of-types are a more general
concept, for which interfaces are a building block.

## Type-of-types and facet types

A [type-of-type](terminology.md#type-of-type) consists of a set of requirements
and a set of names. Requirements are typically a set of interfaces that a type
must satisfy (though other kinds of requirements are added below). The names are
aliases for qualified names in those interfaces.

An interface is one particularly simple example of a type-of-type. For example,
`Vector` as a type-of-type has a set of requirements consisting of the single
interface `Vector`. Its set of names consists of `Add` and `Scale` which are
aliases for the corresponding qualified names inside `Vector` as a namespace.

The requirements determine which types may be cast to a given type-of-type. The
result of casting a type `T` to a type-of-type `I` (written `T as I`) is called
a facet type, you might say a facet type `F` is the `I` facet of `T` if `F` is
`T as I`. The API of `F` is determined by the set of names in the type-of-type.

This general structure of type-of-types holds not just for interfaces, but
others described in the rest of this document.

## Structural interfaces

If the nominal interfaces discussed above are the building blocks for
type-of-types, [structural interfaces](terminology.md#structural-interfaces)
describe how they may be composed together. Unlike nominal interfaces, the name
of a structural interface is not a part of its value. Two different structural
interfaces with the same definition are equivalent even if they have different
names. This is because types don't explicitly specify which structural
interfaces they implement, types automatically implement any structural
interfaces they can satisfy.

A structural interface definition can contain interface requirements using
`impl` declarations and names using `alias` declarations. Note that this allows
us to declare the aspects of a type-of-type directly.

```
structural interface VectorLegoFish {
  // Interface implementation requirements
  impl as Vector;
  impl as LegoFish;
  // Names
  alias Scale = Vector.Scale;
  alias VAdd = Vector.Add;
  alias LFAdd = LegoFish.Add;
}
```

We don't expect users do directly define many structural interfaces, but other
constructs we do expect them to use will be defined in terms of them. For
example, we can define the Carbon builtin `Type` as:

```
structural interface Type { }
```

That is, `Type` is the type-of-type with no requirements (so matches every
type), and defines no names.

```
fn Identity[T:! Type](x: T) -> T {
  // Can accept values of any type. But, since we no nothing about the
  // type, we don't know about any operations on `x` inside this function.
  return x;
}

var i: Int = Identity(3);
var s: String = Identity("string");
```

**Aside:** We can define `auto` as syntactic sugar for `(template _:! Type)`.
This definition allows you to use `auto` as the type for a local variable whose
type can be statically determined by the compiler. It also allows you to use
`auto` as the type of a function parameter, to mean "accepts a value of any
type, and this function will be instantiated separately for every different
type." This is consistent with the
[use of `auto` in the C++20 Abbreviated function template feature](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/function_template#Abbreviated_function_template).

In general we should support the same kinds of declarations in a
`structural interface` definitions as in an `interface`. Generally speaking
declarations in one kind of interface make sense in the other, and there is an
analogy between them. If an `interface` `I` has (non-`alias`) declarations `X`,
`Y`, and `Z`, like so:

```
interface I {
  X;
  Y;
  Z;
}
```

(Here, `X` could be something like `fn F[me: Self]()`.)

Then a type implementing `I` would have `impl as I` with definitions for `X`,
`Y`, and `Z`, as in:

```
class ImplementsI {
  // ...
  impl as I {
    X { ... }
    Y { ... }
    Z { ... }
  }
}
```

But the corresponding `structural interface`, `S`:

```
structural interface S {
  X;
  Y;
  Z;
}
```

would match any type with definitions for `X`, `Y`, and `Z` directly:

```
class ImplementsS {
  // ...
  X { ... }
  Y { ... }
  Z { ... }
}
```

### Subtyping between type-of-types

There is a subtyping relationship between type-of-types that allows you to call
one generic function from another as long as you are calling a function with a
subset of your requirements.

Given a generic type `T` with type-of-type `I1`, it may be
[implicitly cast](terminology.md#subtyping-and-casting) to a type-of-type `I2`,
resulting in `T as I2`, as long as the requirements of `I1` are a superset of
the requirements of `I2`. Further, given a value `x` of type `T`, it can be
implicitly cast to `T as I2`. For example:

```
interface Printable { fn Print[me: Self](); }
interface Renderable { fn Draw[me: Self](); }

structural interface PrintAndRender {
  impl as Printable;
  impl as Renderable;
}
structural interface JustPrint {
  impl as Printable;
}

fn PrintIt[T2:! JustPrint](x2: T2) {
  x2.(Printable.Print)();
}
fn PrintDrawPrint[T1:! PrintAndRender](x1: T1) {
  // x1 implements `Printable` and `Renderable`.
  x1.(Printable.Print)();
  x1.(Renderable.Draw)();
  // Can call `PrintIt` since `T1` satisfies `JustPrint` since
  // it implements `Printable` (in addition to `Renderable`).
  // This calls `PrintIt` with `T2 == T1 as JustPrint` and
  // `x2 == x1 as T2`.
  PrintIt(x1);
}
```

## Combining interfaces by anding type-of-types

In order to support functions that require more than one interface to be
implemented, we provide a combination operator on type-of-types, written `&`.
This operator gives the type-of-type with the union of all the requirements and
the union of the names minus any conflicts.

```
interface Printable {
  fn Print[me: Self]();
}
interface Renderable {
  fn Center[me: Self]() -> (Int, Int);
  fn Draw[me: Self]();
}

// `Printable & Renderable` is syntactic sugar for this type-of-type:
structural interface {
  impl as Printable;
  impl as Renderable;
  alias Print = Printable.Print;
  alias Center = Renderable.Center;
  alias Draw = Renderable.Draw;
}

fn PrintThenDraw[T:! Printable & Renderable](x: T) {
  // Can use methods of `Printable` or `Renderable` on `x` here.
  x.Print();  // Same as `x.(Printable.Print)();`.
  x.Draw();  // Same as `x.(Renderable.Draw)();`.
}

class Sprite {
  // ...
  impl as Printable {
    fn Print[me: Self]() { ... }
  }
  impl as Renderable {
    fn Center[me: Self]() -> (Int, Int) { ... }
    fn Draw[me: Self]() { ... }
  }
}

var s: Sprite = ...;
PrintThenDraw(s);
```

Any conflicting names between the two types are replaced with a name that is an
error to use.

```
interface Renderable {
  fn Center[me: Self]() -> (Int, Int);
  fn Draw[me: Self]();
}
interface EndOfGame {
  fn Draw[me: Self]();
  fn Winner[me: Self](player: Int);
}
// `Renderable & EndOfGame` is syntactic sugar for this type-of-type:
structural interface {
  impl as Renderable;
  impl as EndOfGame;
  alias Center = Renderable.Center;
  // Open question: `forbidden`, `invalid`, or something else?
  forbidden Draw
    message "Ambiguous, use either `(Renderable.Draw)` or `(EndOfGame.Draw)`.";
  alias Winner = EndOfGame.Winner;
}
```

Conflicts can be resolved at the call site using
[the qualified name syntax](#qualified-member-names), or by defining a
structural interface explicitly and renaming the methods:

```
structural interface RenderableAndEndOfGame {
  impl as Renderable;
  impl as EndOfGame;
  alias Center = Renderable.Center;
  alias RenderableDraw = Renderable.Draw;
  alias TieGame = EndOfGame.Draw;
  alias Winner = EndOfGame.Winner;
}

fn RenderTieGame[T:! RenderableAndEndOfGame](x: T) {
  // Calls Renderable.Draw()
  x.RenderableDraw();
  // Calls EndOfGame.Draw()
  x.TieGame();
}
```

Reserving the name when there is a conflict is part of resolving what happens
when you combine more than two type-of-types. If `x` is forbidden in `A`, it is
forbidden in `A & B`, whether or not `B` defines the name `x`. This makes `&`
associative and commutative, and so it is well defined on sets of interfaces, or
other type-of-types, independent of order.

Note that we do _not_ consider two type-of-types using the same name to mean the
same thing to be a conflict. For example, combining a type-of-type with itself
gives itself, `MyTypeOfType & MyTypeOfType == MyTypeOfType`. Also, given two
[interface extensions](#interface-extension) of a common base interface, the sum
should not conflict on any names in the common base.

**Rejected alternative:** Instead of using `&` as the combining operator, we
considered using `+`,
[like Rust](https://rust-lang.github.io/rfcs/0087-trait-bounds-with-plus.html).
See [#531](https://github.com/carbon-language/carbon-lang/issues/531) for the
discussion.

**Future work:** We may want to define another operator on type-of-types for
adding requirements to a type-of-type without affecting the names, and so avoid
the possibility of name conflicts. Note this means the operation is not
commutative. If we call this operator `[&]`, then `A [&] B` has the names of `A`
and `B [&] A` has the names of `B`.

```
// `Printable [&] Renderable` is syntactic sugar for this type-of-type:
structural interface {
  impl as Printable;
  impl as Renderable;
  alias Print = Printable.Print;
}

// `Renderable [&] EndOfGame` is syntactic sugar for this type-of-type:
structural interface {
  impl as Renderable;
  impl as EndOfGame;
  alias Center = Renderable.Center;
  alias Draw = Renderable.Draw;
}
```

Note that all three expressions `A & B`, `A [&] B`, and `B [&] A` have the same
requirements, and so you would be able to switch a function declaration between
them without affecting callers.

Nothing in this design depends on the `[&]` operator, and having both `&` and
`[&]` might be confusing for users, so it makes sense to postpone implementing
`[&]` until we have a demonstrated need. The `[&]` operator seems most useful
for adding requirements for interfaces used for
[operator overloading](#operator-overloading), where merely implementing the
interface is enough to be able to use the operator to access the functionality.

**Alternatives considered:** See
[Carbon: Access to interface methods](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1u_i_s31OMI_apPur7WmVxcYq6MUXsG3oCiKwH893GRI/edit?usp=sharing&resourcekey=0-0lzSNebBMtUBi4lStL825g).

**Comparison with other languages:** This `&` operation on interfaces works very
similarly to Rust's `+` operation, with the main difference being how you
[qualify names when there is a conflict](https://doc.rust-lang.org/rust-by-example/trait/disambiguating.html).

## Interface requiring other interfaces

Some interfaces will depend on other interfaces being implemented for the same
type. For example, in C++,
[the `Container` concept](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/named_req/Container#Other_requirements)
requires all containers to also satisfy the requirements of
`DefaultConstructible`, `CopyConstructible`, `EqualityComparable`, and
`Swappable`. This is already a capability for
[type-of-types in general](#type-of-types-and-facet-types). For consistency we
will use the same semantics and syntax as we do for
[structural interfaces](#structural-interfaces):

```
interface Equatable { fn Equals[me: Self](that: Self) -> Bool; }

interface Iterable {
  fn Advance[addr me: Self*]() -> Bool;
  impl as Equatable;
}

def DoAdvanceAndEquals[T:! Iterable](x: T) {
  // `x` has type `T` that implements `Iterable`, and so has `Advance`.
  x.Advance();
  // `Iterable` requires an implementation of `Equatable`,
  // so `T` also implements `Equatable`.
  x.(Equatable.Equals)(x);
}

class Iota {
  impl as Iterable { fn Advance[me: Self]() { ... } }
  impl as Equatable { fn Equals[me: Self](that: Self) -> Bool { ... } }
}
var x: Iota;
DoAdvanceAndEquals(x);
```

Like with structural interfaces, an interface implementation requirement doesn't
by itself add any names to the interface, but again those can be added with
`alias` declarations:

```
interface Hashable {
  fn Hash[me: Self]() -> UInt64;
  impl as Equatable;
  alias Equals = Equatable.Equals;
}

def DoHashAndEquals[T:! Hashable](x: T) {
  // Now both `Hash` and `Equals` are available directly:
  x.Hash();
  x.Equals(x);
}
```

**Comparison with other languages:**
[This feature is called "Supertraits" in Rust](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch19-03-advanced-traits.html#using-supertraits-to-require-one-traits-functionality-within-another-trait).

### Interface extension

When implementing an interface, we should allow implementing the aliased names
as well. In the case of `Hashable` above, this includes all the members of
`Equatable`, obviating the need to implement `Equatable` itself:

```
class Song {
  impl as Hashable {
    fn Hash[me: Self]() -> UInt64 { ... }
    fn Equals[me: Self](that: Self) -> Bool { ... }
  }
}
var y: Song;
DoHashAndEquals(y);
```

This allows us to say that `Hashable`
["extends"](terminology.md#extending-an-interface) `Equatable`, with some
benefits:

-   This allows `Equatable` to be an implementation detail of `Hashable`.
-   This allows types implementing `Hashable` to implement all of its API in one
    place.
-   This reduces the boilerplate for types implementing `Hashable`.

We expect this concept to be common enough to warrant dedicated syntax:

```
interface Equatable { fn Equals[me: Self](that: Self) -> Bool; }

interface Hashable {
  extends Equatable;
  fn Hash[me: Self]() -> UInt64;
}
// is equivalent to the definition of Hashable from before:
// interface Hashable {
//   impl as Equatable;
//   alias Equals = Equatable.Equals;
//   fn Hash[me: Self]() -> UInt64;
// }
```

No names in `Hashable` are allowed to conflict with names in `Equatable` (unless
those names are marked as `upcoming` or `deprecated` as in
[evolution future work](#evolution)). Hopefully this won't be a problem in
practice, since interface extension is a very closely coupled relationship, but
this may be something we will have to revisit in the future.

Examples:

-   The C++
    [Boost.Graph library](https://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_74_0/libs/graph/doc/)
    [graph concepts](https://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_74_0/libs/graph/doc/graph_concepts.html#fig:graph-concepts)
    has many refining relationships between concepts.
    [Carbon generics use case: graph library](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xk0GLtpBl2OOnf3F_6Z-A3DtTt-r7wdOZ5wPipYUSO0/edit?usp=sharing&resourcekey=0-mBSmwn6b6jwbLaQw2WG6OA)
    shows how those concepts might be translated into Carbon interfaces.
-   The [C++ concepts](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/named_req) for
    containers, iterators, and concurrency include many requirement
    relationships.
-   Swift protocols, such as
    [Collection](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/collection).

To write an interface extending multiple interfaces, use multiple `extends`
declarations. For example, the
[`BinaryInteger` protocol in Swift](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/binaryinteger)
inherits from `CustomStringConvertible`, `Hashable`, `Numeric`, and `Stridable`.
The [`SetAlgeba` protocol](https://swiftdoc.org/v5.1/protocol/setalgebra/)
extends `Equatable` and `ExpressibleByArrayLiteral`, which would be declared in
Carbon:

```
interface SetAlgebra {
  extends Equatable;
  extends ExpressibleByArrayLiteral;
}
```

**Alternative considered:** The `extends` declarations are in the body of the
`interface` definition instead of the header so we can use
[associated types (defined below)](#associated-types) also defined in the body
in parameters or constraints of the interface being extended.

```
// A type can implement `ConvertibleTo` many times, using
// different values of `T`.
interface ConvertibleTo(T:! Type) { ... }

// A type can only implement `PreferredConversion` once.
interface PreferredConversion {
  let AssociatedType:! Type;
  extends ConvertibleTo(AssociatedType);
}
```

#### `extends` and `impl` with structural interfaces

The `extends` declaration makes sense with the same meaning inside a
[`structural interface`](#structural-interfaces), and so is also supported.

```
interface Media {
  fn Play[me: Self]();
}
interface Job {
  fn Run[me: Self]();
}

structural interface Combined {
  extends Media;
  extends Job;
}
```

This definition of `Combined` is equivalent to requiring both the `Media` and
`Job` interfaces being implemented, and aliases their methods.

```
// Equivalent
structural interface Combined {
  impl as Media;
  alias Play = Media.Play;
  impl as Job;
  alias Run = Job.Run;
}
```

Notice how `Combined` has aliases for all the methods in the interfaces it
requires. That condition is sufficient to allow a type to `impl` the structural
interface:

```
class Song {
  impl as Combined {
    fn Play[me: Self]() { ... }
    fn Run[me: Self]() { ... }
  }
}
```

This is equivalent to implementing the required interfaces directly:

```
class Song {
  impl as Media {
    fn Play[me: Self]() { ... }
  }
  impl as Job {
    fn Run[me: Self]() { ... }
  }
}
```

This is just like you get an implementation of `Equatable` by implementing
`Hashable` when `Hashable` extends `Equatable`. This provides a tool useful for
[evolution](#evolution).

Conversely, an `interface` can extend a `structural interface`:

```
interface MovieCodec {
  extends Combined;

  fn Load[addr me: Self*](filename: String);
}
```

This gives `MovieCodec` the same requirements and names as `Combined`, and so is
equivalent to:

```
interface MovieCodec {
  impl as Media;
  alias Play = Media.Play;
  impl as Job;
  alias Run = Job.Run;

  fn Load[addr me: Self*](filename: String);
}
```

#### Diamond dependency issue

Consider this set of interfaces, simplified from
[this example generic graph library doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xk0GLtpBl2OOnf3F_6Z-A3DtTt-r7wdOZ5wPipYUSO0/edit?resourcekey=0-mBSmwn6b6jwbLaQw2WG6OA#):

```
interface Graph {
  fn Source[addr me: Self*](e: EdgeDescriptor) -> VertexDescriptor;
  fn Target[addr me: Self*](e: EdgeDescriptor) -> VertexDescriptor;
}

interface IncidenceGraph {
  extends Graph;
  fn OutEdges[addr me: Self*](u: VertexDescriptor)
    -> (EdgeIterator, EdgeIterator);
}

interface EdgeListGraph {
  extends Graph;
  fn Edges[addr me: Self*]() -> (EdgeIterator, EdgeIterator);
}
```

We need to specify what happens when a graph type implements both
`IncidenceGraph` and `EdgeListGraph`, since both interfaces extend the `Graph`
interface.

```
class MyEdgeListIncidenceGraph {
  impl as IncidenceGraph { ... }
  impl as EdgeListGraph { ... }
}
```

The rule is that we need one definition of each method of `Graph`. Each method
though could be defined in the `impl` block of `IncidenceGraph`,
`EdgeListGraph`, or `Graph`. These would all be valid:

-   `IncidenceGraph` implements all methods of `Graph`, `EdgeListGraph`
    implements none of them.

```
class MyEdgeListIncidenceGraph {
  impl as IncidenceGraph {
    fn Source[me: Self](e: EdgeDescriptor) -> VertexDescriptor { ... }
    fn Target[me: Self](e: EdgeDescriptor) -> VertexDescriptor { ... }
    fn OutEdges[addr me: Self*](u: VertexDescriptor)
        -> (EdgeIterator, EdgeIterator) { ... }
  }
  impl as EdgeListGraph {
    fn Edges[addr me: Self*]() -> (EdgeIterator, EdgeIterator) { ... }
  }
}
```

-   `IncidenceGraph` and `EdgeListGraph` implement all methods of `Graph`
    between them, but with no overlap.

```
class MyEdgeListIncidenceGraph {
  impl as IncidenceGraph {
    fn Source[me: Self](e: EdgeDescriptor) -> VertexDescriptor { ... }
    fn OutEdges[addr me: Self*](u: VertexDescriptor)
        -> (EdgeIterator, EdgeIterator) { ... }
  }
  impl as EdgeListGraph {
    fn Target[me: Self](e: EdgeDescriptor) -> VertexDescriptor { ... }
    fn Edges[addr me: Self*]() -> (EdgeIterator, EdgeIterator) { ... }
  }
}
```

-   Explicitly implementing `Graph`.

```
class MyEdgeListIncidenceGraph {
  impl as Graph {
    fn Source[me: Self](e: EdgeDescriptor) -> VertexDescriptor { ... }
    fn Target[me: Self](e: EdgeDescriptor) -> VertexDescriptor { ... }
  }
  impl as IncidenceGraph { ... }
  impl as EdgeListGraph { ... }
}
```

-   Implementing `Graph` externally.

```
class MyEdgeListIncidenceGraph {
  impl as IncidenceGraph { ... }
  impl as EdgeListGraph { ... }
}
external impl as Graph {
  fn Source[me: Self](e: EdgeDescriptor) -> VertexDescriptor { ... }
  fn Target[me: Self](e: EdgeDescriptor) -> VertexDescriptor { ... }
}
```

This last point means that there are situations where we can only detect a
missing method definition by the end of the file. This doesn't delay other
aspects of semantic checking, which will just assume that these methods will
eventually be provided.

### Use case: overload resolution

Implementing an extended interface is an example of a more specific match for
[lookup resolution](#lookup-resolution-and-specialization). For example, this
could be used to provide different implementations of an algorithm depending on
the capabilities of the iterator being passed in:

```
interface ForwardIntIterator {
  fn Advance[addr me: Self*]();
  fn Get[me: Self]() -> Int;
}
interface BidirectionalIntIterator {
  extends ForwardIntIterator;
  fn Back[addr me: Self*]();
}
interface RandomAccessIntIterator {
  extends BidirectionalIntIterator;
  fn Skip[addr me: Self*](offset: Int);
  fn Difference[me: Self](that: Self) -> Int;
}

fn SearchInSortedList[IterT:! ForwardIntIterator]
    (begin: IterT, end: IterT, needle: Int) -> Bool {
  ... // does linear search
}
// Will prefer the following overload when it matches
// since it is more specific.
fn SearchInSortedList[IterT:! RandomAccessIntIterator]
    (begin: IterT, end: IterT, needle: Int) -> Bool {
  ... // does binary search
}
```

This would be an example of the more general rule that an interface `A`
requiring an implementation of interface `B` means `A` is more specific than
`B`.

## Type compatibility

None of the casts between facet types change the implementation of any
interfaces for a type. So the result of a cast does not depend on the sequence
of casts you perform, just the original type and the final type-of-type. That
is, these types will all be equal:

-   `T as I`
-   `(T as A) as I`
-   `(((T as A) as B) as C) as I`

Now consider a type with a generic type parameter, like a hash map type:

```
interface Hashable { ... }
class HashMap(KeyT:! Hashable, ValueT:! Type) { ... }
```

If we write something like `HashMap(String, Int)` the type we actually get is:

```
HashMap(String as Hashable, Int as Type)
```

This is the same type we will get if we pass in some other facet types in, so
all of these types are equal:

-   `HashMap(String, Int)`
-   `HashMap(String as Hashable, Int as Type)`
-   `HashMap((String as Printable) as Hashable, Int)`
-   `HashMap((String as Printable & Hashable) as Hashable, Int)`

This means we don't generally need to worry about getting the wrong facet type
as the argument for a generic type. This means we don't get type mismatches when
calling functions as in this example, where the type parameters have different
constraints than the type requires:

```
fn PrintValue
    [KeyT:! Printable & Hashable, ValueT:! Printable]
    (map: HashMap(KeyT, ValueT), key: KeyT) { ... }

var m: HashMap(String, Int);
PrintValue(m, "key");
```

## Adapting types

Since interfaces may only be implemented for a type once, and we limit where
implementations may be added to a type, there is a need to allow the user to
switch the type of a value to access different interface implementations. We
therefore provide a way to create new types
[compatible with](terminology.md#compatible-types) existing types with different
APIs, in particular with different interface implementations, by
[adapting](terminology.md#adapting-a-type) them:

```
interface Printable {
  fn Print[me: Self]();
}
interface Comparable {
  fn Less[me: Self](that: Self) -> Bool;
}
class Song {
  impl as Printable { fn Print[me: Self]() { ... } }
}
adapter SongByTitle for Song {
  impl as Comparable {
    fn Less[me: Self](that: Self) -> Bool { ... }
  }
}
adapter FormattedSong for Song {
  impl as Printable { fn Print[me: Self]() { ... } }
}
adapter FormattedSongByTitle for Song {
  impl as Printable = FormattedSong as Printable;
  impl as Comparable = SongByTitle as Comparable;
}
```

This allows us to provide implementations of new interfaces (as in
`SongByTitle`), provide different implementations of the same interface (as in
`FormattedSong`), or mix and match implementations from other compatible types
(as in `FormattedSongByTitle`). The rules are:

-   You can add any declaration that you could add to a class except for
    declarations that would change the representation of the type. This means
    you can add functions, interface implementations, and aliases, but not
    fields, base classes, or virtual functions.
-   The adapted type is compatible with the original type, and that relationship
    is an equivalence class, so all of `Song`, `SongByTitle`, `FormattedSong`,
    and `FormattedSongByTitle` end up compatible with each other.
-   Since adapted types are compatible with the original type, you may
    explicitly cast between them, but there is no implicit casting between these
    types (unlike between a type and one of its facet types / impls).
-   For the purposes of generics, we only need to support adding interface
    implementations. But this `adapter` feature could be used more generally,
    such as to add methods.

Inside an adapter, the `Self` type matches the adapter. Members of the original
type may be accessed like any other facet type; either by a cast:

```
adapter SongByTitle for Song {
  impl as Comparable {
    fn Less[me: Self](that: Self) -> Bool {
      return (this as Song).Title() < (that as Song).Title();
    }
  }
}
```

or using qualified names:

```
adapter SongByTitle for Song {
  impl as Comparable {
    fn Less[me: Self](that: Self) -> Bool {
      return this.(Song.Title)() < that(Song.Title)();
    }
  }
}
```

**Open question:** As an alternative to:

```
impl as Printable = FormattedSong as Printable;
```

we could allow users to write:

```
impl as Printable = FormattedSong;
```

This would remove ceremony that the compiler doesn't need. The concern is
whether it makes sense or is a category error. In this example, is
`FormattedSong`, a type, a suitable value to provide when asking for a
`Printable` implementation? An argument for this terser syntax is that the
implicit conversion is legal in other contexts:

```
// ✅ Legal implicit conversion
var v:! Printable = FormattedSong;
```

**Comparison with other languages:** This matches the Rust idiom called
"newtype", which is used to implement traits on types while avoiding coherence
problems, see
[here](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch19-03-advanced-traits.html#using-the-newtype-pattern-to-implement-external-traits-on-external-types)
and
[here](https://github.com/Ixrec/rust-orphan-rules#user-content-why-are-the-orphan-rules-controversial).
Rust's mechanism doesn't directly support reusing implementations, though some
of that is provided by macros defined in libraries. Haskell has a
[`newtype` feature](https://wiki.haskell.org/Newtype) as well. Haskell's feature
doesn't directly support reusing implementations either, but the most popular
compiler provides it as
[an extension](https://ghc.gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/doc/users_guide/exts/newtype_deriving.html).

### Adapter compatibility

The framework from the [type compatibility section](#type-compatibility) allows
us to evaluate when we can cast between two different arguments to a
parameterized type. Consider three compatible types, all of which implement
`Hashable`:

```
class Song {
  impl as Hashable { ... }
  impl as Printable { ... }
}
adapter SongHashedByTitle for Song {
  impl as Hashable { ... }
}
adapter PlayableSong for Song {
  impl as Hashable = Song as Hashable;
  impl as Media { ... }
}
```

Observe that `Song as Hashable` is different from
`SongHashedByTitle as Hashable`, since they have different definitions of the
`Hashable` interface even though they are compatible types. However
`Song as Hashable` and `PlayableSong as Hashable` are almost the same. In
addition to using the same data representation, they both implement one
interface, `Hashable`, and use the same implementation for that interface. The
one difference between them is that `Song as Hashable` may be implicitly cast to
`Song`, which implements interface `Printable`, and `PlayableSong as Hashable`
may be implicilty cast to `PlayableSong`, which implements interface `Media`.
This means that it is safe to cast between
`HashMap(Song, Int) == HashMap(Song as Hashable, Int)` and
`HashMap(PlayableSong, Int) == HashMap(PlayableSong as Hashable, Int)` (though
maybe only with an explicit cast) but
`HashMap(SongHashedByTitle, Int) == HashMap(SongHashByTitle as Hashable, Int)`
is incompatible. This is a relief, because we know that in practice the
invariants of a `HashMap` implementation rely on the hashing function staying
the same.

### Extending adapter

Frequently we expect that the adapter type will want to preserve most or all of
the API of the original type. The two most common cases expected are adding and
replacing an interface implementation. Users would indicate that an adapter
starts from the original type's existing API by using the `extends` keyword
instead of `for`:

```
class Song {
  impl as Hashable { ... }
  impl as Printable { ... }
}

adapter SongByArtist extends Song {
  // Add an implementation of a new interface
  impl as Comparable { ... }

  // Replace an existing implementation of an interface
  // with an alternative.
  impl as Hashable { ... }
}
```

The resulting type `SongByArtist` would:

-   implement `Comparable`, unlike `Song`,
-   implement `Hashable`, but differently than `Song`, and
-   implement `Printable`, inherited from `Song`.

Unlike the similar `class B extends A` notation, `adaptor B extends A` is
permitted even if `A` is a final class. Also, there is no implicit conversion
from `B` to `A`, matching `adapter`...`for` but unlike class extension.

**Future work:** We may need additional mechanisms for changing the API in the
adapter. For example, to resolve conflicts we might want to be able to move the
implementation of a specific interface into an [external impl](#external-impl).

### Use case: Using independent libraries together

Imagine we have two packages that are developed independently. Package
`CompareLib` defines an interface `CompareLib.Comparable` and a generic
algorithm `CompareLib.Sort` that operates on types that implement
`CompareLib.Comparable`. Package `SongLib` defines a type `SongLib.Song`.
Neither has a dependency on the other, so neither package defines an
implementation for `CompareLib.Comparable` for type `SongLib.Song`. A user that
wants to pass a value of type `SongLib.Song` to `CompareLib.Sort` has to define
an adapter that provides an implementation of `CompareLib.Comparable` for
`SongLib.Song`. This adapter will probably use the
[`extends` facility of adapters](#extending-adapter) to preserve the
`SongLib.Song` API.

```
import CompareLib;
import SongLib;

adapter Song extends SongLib.Song {
  impl as CompareLib.Comparable { ... }
}
// Or, to keep the names from CompareLib.Comparable out of Song's API:
adapter Song extends SongLib.Song { }
external impl Song as CompareLib.Comparable { ... }
```

The caller can either cast `SongLib.Song` values to `Song` when calling
`CompareLib.Sort` or just start with `Song` values in the first place.

```
var lib_song: SongLib.Song = ...;
CompareLib.Sort((lib_song as Song,));

var song: Song = ...;
CompareLib.Sort((song,));
```

### Adapter with stricter invariants

**Future work:** Rust also uses the newtype idiom to create types with
additional invariants or other information encoded in the type
([1](https://doc.rust-lang.org/rust-by-example/generics/new_types.html),
[2](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch19-04-advanced-types.html#using-the-newtype-pattern-for-type-safety-and-abstraction),
[3](https://www.worthe-it.co.za/blog/2020-10-31-newtype-pattern-in-rust.html)).
This is used to record in the type system that some data has passed validation
checks, like `ValidDate` with the same data layout as `Date`. Or to record the
units associated with a value, such as `Seconds` versus `Milliseconds` or `Feet`
versus `Meters`. We should have some way of restricting the casts between a type
and an adapter to address this use case.

### Application: Defining an impl for use by other types

Let's say we want to provide a possible implementation of an interface for use
by types for which that implementation would be appropriate. We can do that by
defining an adapter implementing the interface that is parameterized on the type
it is adapting. That impl may then be pulled in using the `impl as ... = ...;`
syntax.

```
interface Comparable {
  fn Less[me: Self](that: Self) -> Bool;
}
adapter ComparableFromDifferenceFn
    (T:! Type, Difference:! fnty(T, T)->Int) for T {
  impl as Comparable {
    fn Less[me: Self](that: Self) -> Bool {
      return Difference(this, that) < 0;
    }
  }
}
class IntWrapper {
  var x: Int;
  fn Difference(this: Self, that: Self) {
    return that.x - this.x;
  }
  impl as Comparable =
      ComparableFromDifferenceFn(IntWrapper, Difference)
      as Comparable;
}
```

## Associated constants

In addition to associated methods, we allow other kinds of
[associated entities](terminology.md#associated-entity). For consistency, we use
the same syntax to describe a constant in an interface as in a type without
assigning a value. As constants, they are declared using the `let` introducer.
For example, a fixed-dimensional point type could have the dimension as an
associated constant.

```
interface NSpacePoint {
  let N:! Int;
  // The following require: 0 <= i < N.
  fn Get[addr me: Self*](i: Int) -> Float64;
  fn Set[addr me: Self*](i: Int, value: Float64);
  // Associated constants may be used in signatures:
  fn SetAll[addr me: Self*](value: Array(Float64, N));
}
```

Implementations of `NSpacePoint` for different types might have different values
for `N`:

```
class Point2D {
  impl as NSpacePoint {
    let N:! Int = 2;
    fn Get[addr me: Self*](i: Int) -> Float64 { ... }
    fn Set[addr me: Self*](i: Int, value: Float64) { ... }
    fn SetAll[addr me: Self*](value: Array(Float64, 2)) { ... }
  }
}

class Point3D {
  impl as NSpacePoint {
    let N:! Int = 3;
    fn Get[addr me: Self*](i: Int) -> Float64 { ... }
    fn Set[addr me: Self*](i: Int, value: Float64) { ... }
    fn SetAll[addr me: Self*](value: Array(Float64, 3)) { ... }
  }
}
```

And these values may be accessed as members of the type:

```
Assert(Point2D.N == 2);
Assert(Point3D.N == 3);

fn PrintPoint[PointT:! NSpacePoint](p: PointT) {
  for (var i: Int = 0; i < PointT.N; ++i) {
    if (i > 0) { Print(", "); }
    Print(p.Get(i));
  }
}

fn ExtractPoint[PointT:! NSpacePoint](
    p: PointT,
    dest: Array(Float64, PointT.N)*) {
  for (var i: Int = 0; i < PointT.N; ++i) {
    (*dest)[i] = p.Get(i);
  }
}
```

**Comparison with other languages:** This feature is also called
[associated constants in Rust](https://doc.rust-lang.org/reference/items/associated-items.html#associated-constants).

**Aside:** In general, the use of `:!` here means these `let` declarations will
only have compile-time and not runtime storage associated with them.

### Associated class functions

To be consistent with normal
[class function](/docs/design/classes.md#class-functions) declaration syntax,
associated class functions are written:

```
interface DeserializeFromString {
  fn Deserialize(serialized: String) -> Self;
}

class MySerializableType {
  var i: Int;

  impl as DeserializeFromString {
    fn Deserialize(serialized: String) -> Self {
      return (.i = StringToInt(serialized));
    }
  }
}

var x: MySerializableType = MySerializableType.Deserialize("3");

fn Deserialize(T:! DeserializeFromString, serialized: String) -> T {
  return T.Deserialize(serialized);
}
var y: MySerializableType = Deserialize(MySerializableType, "4");
```

This is instead of declaring an associated constant using `let` with a function
type.

Together associated methods and associated class functions are called
_associated functions_, much like together methods and class functions are
called [member functions](/docs/design/classes.md#member-functions).

## Associated types

Associated types are [associated entities](terminology.md#associated-entity)
that happen to be types. These are particularly interesting since they can be
used in the signatures of associated methods or functions, to allow the
signatures of methods to vary from implementation to implementation. We already
have one example of this: the `Self` type discussed
[above in the "Interfaces" section](#interfaces). For other cases, we can say
that the interface declares that each implementation will provide a type under a
specific name. For example:

```
interface StackAssociatedType {
  let ElementType:! Type;
  fn Push[addr me: Self*](value: ElementType);
  fn Pop[addr me: Self*]() -> ElementType;
  fn IsEmpty[addr me: Self*]() -> Bool;
}
```

Here we have an interface called `StackAssociatedType` which defines two
methods, `Push` and `Pop`. The signatures of those two methods declare them as
accepting or returning values with the type `ElementType`, which any implementer
of `StackAssociatedType` must also define. For example, maybe `DynamicArray`
implements `StackAssociatedType`:

```
class DynamicArray(T:! Type) {
  class IteratorType { ... }
  fn Begin[addr me: Self*]() -> IteratorType;
  fn End[addr me: Self*]() -> IteratorType;
  fn Insert[addr me: Self*](pos: IteratorType, value: T);
  fn Remove[addr me: Self*](pos: IteratorType);

  impl as StackAssociatedType {
    // Set the associated type `ElementType` to `T`.
    let ElementType:! Type = T;
    fn Push[addr me: Self*](value: ElementType) {
      this->Insert(this->End(), value);
    }
    fn Pop[addr me: Self*]() -> ElementType {
      var pos: IteratorType = this->End();
      Assert(pos != this->Begin());
      --pos;
      returned var ret: ElementType = *pos;
      this->Remove(pos);
      return var;
    }
    fn IsEmpty[addr me: Self*]() -> Bool {
      return this->Begin() == this->End();
    }
  }
}
```

**Alternatives considered:** See
[other syntax options considered for specifying associated types](/proposals/p0731.md#syntax-for-associated-constants).
In particular, it was deemed that
[Swift's approach of inferring the associated type from method signatures in the impl](https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/LanguageGuide/Generics.html#ID190)
was unneeded complexity.

The definition of the `StackAssociatedType` is sufficient for writing a generic
function that operates on anything implementing that interface, for example:

```
fn PeekAtTopOfStack[StackType:! StackAssociatedType](s: StackType*)
    -> StackType.ElementType {
  var top: StackType.ElementType = s->Pop();
  s->Push(top);
  return top;
}

var my_array: DynamicArray(i32) = (1, 2, 3);
// PeekAtTopOfStack's `StackType` is set to
// `DynamicArray(i32) as StackAssociatedType`.
// `StackType.ElementType` becomes `i32`.
Assert(PeekAtTopOfStack(my_array) == 3);
```

Associated types can also be implemented using a
[member type](/docs/design/classes.md#member-type).

```
interface Container {
  let IteratorType:! Iterator;
  ...
}

class DynamicArray(T:! Type) {
  ...
  impl as Container {
    class IteratorType { ... }
    ...
  }
}
```

For context, see
["Interface type parameters and associated types" in the generics terminology document](terminology.md#interface-type-parameters-versus-associated-types).

**Comparison with other languages:** Both
[Rust](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch19-03-advanced-traits.html#specifying-placeholder-types-in-trait-definitions-with-associated-types)
and [Swift](https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/LanguageGuide/Generics.html#ID189)
support associated types.

### Model

The associated type can be modeled by a witness table field in the interface's
witness table.

```
interface Iterator {
  fn Advance[addr me: Self*]();
}

interface Container {
  let IteratorType:! Iterator;
  fn Begin[addr me: Self*]() -> IteratorType;
}
```

is represented by:

```
class Iterator(Self:! Type) {
  var Advance: fnty(this: Self*);
  ...
}
class Container(Self:! Type) {
  // Representation type for the iterator.
  let IteratorType:! Type;
  // Witness that IteratorType implements Iterator.
  var iterator_impl: Iterator(IteratorType)*;

  // Method
  var Begin: fnty (this: Self*) -> IteratorType;
  ...
}
```

## Parameterized interfaces

Associated types don't change the fact that a type can only implement an
interface at most once.

If instead you want a family of related interfaces, one per possible value of a
type parameter, multiple of which could be implemented for a single type, you
would use parameterized interfaces. To write a parameterized version the stack
interface instead of using associated types, write a parameter list after the
name of the interface instead of the associated type declaration:

```
interface StackParameterized(ElementType:! Type) {
  fn Push[addr me: Self*](value: ElementType);
  fn Pop[addr me: Self*]() -> ElementType;
  fn IsEmpty[addr me: Self*]() -> Bool;
}
```

Then `StackParameterized(Fruit)` and `StackParameterized(Veggie)` would be
considered different interfaces, with distinct implementations.

```
class Produce {
  var fruit: DynamicArray(Fruit);
  var veggie: DynamicArray(Veggie);
  impl as StackParameterized(Fruit) {
    fn Push[addr me: Self*](value: Fruit) {
      this->fruit.Push(value);
    }
    fn Pop[addr me: Self*]() -> Fruit {
      return this->fruit.Pop();
    }
    fn IsEmpty[addr me: Self*]() -> Bool {
      return this->fruit.IsEmpty();
    }
  }
  impl as StackParameterized(Veggie) {
    fn Push[addr me: Self*](value: Veggie) {
      this->veggie.Push(value);
    }
    fn Pop[addr me: Self*]() -> Veggie {
      return this->veggie.Pop();
    }
    fn IsEmpty[addr me: Self*]() -> Bool {
      return this->veggie.IsEmpty();
    }
  }
}
```

Unlike associated types in interfaces and parameters to types, interface
parameters can't be deduced. For example, if we were to rewrite
[the `PeekAtTopOfStack` example in the "associated types" section](#associated-types)
for `StackParameterized(T)` it would generate a compile error:

```
// ❌ Error: can't deduce interface parameter `T`.
fn BrokenPeekAtTopOfStackParameterized
    [T:! Type, StackType:! StackParameterized(T)]
    (s: StackType*) -> T { ... }
```

This error is because the compiler can not determine if `T` should be `Fruit` or
`Veggie` when passing in argument of type `Produce*`. The function's signature
would have to be changed so that the value for `T` could be determined from the
explicit parameters.

```
fn PeekAtTopOfStackParameterized
    [T:! Type, StackType:! StackParameterized(T)]
    (s: StackType*, _: singleton_type_of(T)) -> T { ... }

var produce: Produce = ...;
var top_fruit: Fruit =
    PeekAtTopOfStackParameterized(&produce, Fruit);
var top_veggie: Veggie =
    PeekAtTopOfStackParameterized(&produce, Veggie);
```

The pattern `_: singleton_type_of(T)` is a placeholder syntax for an expression
that will only match `T`, until issue
[#578: Value patterns as function parameters](https://github.com/carbon-language/carbon-lang/issues/578)
is resolved. Using that pattern in the explicit parameter list allows us to make
`T` available earlier in the declaration so it can be passed as the argument to
the parameterized interface `StackParameterized`.

This approach is useful for the `ComparableTo(T)` interface, where a type might
be comparable with multiple other types, and in fact interfaces for
[operator overloads](#operator-overloading) more generally. Example:

```
interface EquatableWith(T:! Type) {
  fn Equals[me: Self](that: T) -> Bool;
  ...
}
class Complex {
  var real: f64;
  var imag: f64;
  // Can implement this interface more than once as long as it has different
  // arguments.
  impl as EquatableWith(Complex) { ... }
  impl as EquatableWith(f64) { ... }
}
```

All interface parameters must be marked as "generic", using the `:!` syntax.
This reflects these two properties of these parameters:

-   They must be resolved at compile-time, and so can't be passed regular
    dynamic values.
-   We allow either generic or template values to be passed in.

**Context:** See
[interface type parameters](terminology.md#interface-type-parameters-versus-associated-types)
in the terminology doc.

**Note:** Interface parameters aren't required to be types, but that is the vast
majority of cases. As an example, if we had an interface that allowed a type to
define how the tuple-member-read operator would work, the index of the member
could be an interface parameter:

```
interface ReadTupleMember(index:! u32) {
  let T:! Type;
  // Returns me[index]
  fn Get[me: Self]() -> T;
}
```

This requires that the index be known at compile time, but allows different
indices to be associated with different types.

**Caveat:** When implementing an interface twice for a type, you need to be sure
that the interface parameters will always be different. For example:

```
interface Map(FromType:! Type, ToType:! Type) {
  fn Map[addr me: Self*](needle: FromType) -> Optional(ToType);
}
class Bijection(FromType:! Type, ToType:! Type) {
  impl as Map(FromType, ToType) { ... }
  impl as Map(ToType, FromType) { ... }
}
// ❌ Error: Bijection has two impls of interface Map(String, String)
var oops: Bijection(String, String) = ...;
```

In this case, it would be better to have an [adapting type](#adapting-types) to
contain the `impl` for the reverse map lookup, instead of implementing the `Map`
interface twice:

```
class Bijection(FromType:! Type, ToType:! Type) {
  impl as Map(FromType, ToType) { ... }
}
adapter ReverseLookup(FromType:! Type, ToType:! Type)
    for Bijection(FromType, ToType) {
  impl as Map(ToType, FromType) { ... }
}
```

**Comparison with other languages:** Rust calls
[traits with type parameters "generic traits"](https://doc.rust-lang.org/reference/items/traits.html#generic-traits)
and
[uses them for operator overloading](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch19-03-advanced-traits.html#default-generic-type-parameters-and-operator-overloading).
Note that Rust further supports defaults for those type parameters (such as
`Self`).

[Rust uses the term "type parameters"](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/blob/master/text/0195-associated-items.md#clearer-trait-matching)
for both interface type parameters and associated types. The difference is that
interface parameters are "inputs" since they _determine_ which `impl` to use,
and associated types are "outputs" since they are determined _by_ the `impl`,
but play no role in selecting the `impl`.

### Impl lookup

Let's say you have some interface `I(T, U(V))` being implemented for some type
`A(B(C(D), E))`. To satisfy the orphan rule for coherence, that `impl` must be
defined in some library that must be imported in any code that looks up whether
that interface is implemented for that type. This requires that `impl` is
defined in the same library that defines the interface or one of the names
needed by the type. That is, the `impl` must be defined with one of `I`, `T`,
`U`, `V`, `A`, `B`, `C`, `D`, or `E`. We further require anything looking up
this `impl` to import the _definitions_ of all of those names. Seeing a forward
declaration of these names is insufficient, since you can presumably see forward
declarations without seeing an `impl` with the definition. This accomplishes a
few goals:

-   The compiler can check that there is only one definition of any `impl` that
    is actually used, avoiding
    [One Definition Rule (ODR)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_Definition_Rule)
    problems.
-   Every attempt to use an `impl` will see the exact same `impl`, making the
    interpretation and semantics of code consistent no matter its context, in
    accordance with the
    [low context-sensitivity principle](/docs/project/principles/low_context_sensitivity.md).
-   Allowing the `impl` to be defined with either the interface or the type
    addresses the
    [expression problem](https://eli.thegreenplace.net/2016/the-expression-problem-and-its-solutions).

Note that [the rules for specialization](#lookup-resolution-and-specialization)
do allow there to be more than one `impl` to be defined for a type, as long as
one can unambiguously be picked as most specific.

**References:** Implementation coherence is
[defined in terminology](terminology.md#coherence), and is
[a goal for Carbon](goals.md#coherence). More detail can be found in
[this appendix with the rationale and alternatives considered](appendix-coherence.md).

### Parameterized structural interfaces

We should also allow the [structural interface](#structural-interfaces)
construct to support parameters. Parameters would work the same way as for
regular, that is nominal or non-structural, interfaces.

## Future work

### Constraints

We will need to be able to express constraints beyond "type implements these
interfaces."

### Conditional conformance

[The problem](terminology.md#conditional-conformance) we are trying to solve
here is expressing that we have an `impl` of some interface for some type, but
only if some additional type restrictions are met.

### Parameterized impls

Also known as "blanket `impl`s", these are when you have an `impl` definition
that is parameterized so it applies to more than a single type and interface
combination.

#### Lookup resolution and specialization

For this to work, we need a rule that picks a single `impl` in the case where
there are multiple `impl` definitions that match a particular type and interface
combination.

### Other constraints as type-of-types

There are some constraints that we will naturally represent as named
type-of-types that the user can specify.

#### Sized types and type-of-types

Like Rust, we may have types that have values whose size is only determined at
runtime. Many functions may want to restrict to types with known size.

### Dynamic types

Generics provide enough structure to support runtime dispatch for values with
types that vary at runtime, without giving up type safety. Both Rust and Swift
have demonstrated the value of this feature.

#### Runtime type parameters

This feature is about allowing a function's type parameter to be passed in as a
dynamic (non-generic) parameter. All values of that type would still be required
to have the same type.

#### Runtime type fields

Instead of passing in a single type parameter to a function, we could store a
type per value. This changes the data layout of the value, and so is a somewhat
more invasive change. It also means that when a function operates on multiple
values they could have different real types.

### Abstract return types

This lets you return am anonymous type implementing an interface from a
function.
[Rust has this feature](https://rust-lang.github.io/rfcs/1522-conservative-impl-trait.html).

### Interface defaults

Rust supports specifying defaults for
[interface parameters](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch19-03-advanced-traits.html#default-generic-type-parameters-and-operator-overloading),
[methods](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch10-02-traits.html#default-implementations),
[associated constants](https://doc.rust-lang.org/reference/items/associated-items.html#associated-constants-examples).
We should support this too. It is helpful for evolution, as well as reducing
boilerplate. Defaults address the gap between the minimum necessary for a type
to provide the desired functionality of an interface and the breadth of API that
user's desire.

### Evolution

There are a collection of use cases for making different changes to interfaces
that are already in use. These should be addressed either by describing how they
can be accomplished with existing generics features, or by adding features.

In addition, evolution from (C++ or Carbon) templates to generics needs to be
supported and made safe.

### Testing

The idea is that you would write tests alongside an interface that validate the
expected behavior of any type implementing that interface.

### Operator overloading

We will need a story for defining how an operation is overloaded for a type by
implementing an interface for that type.

### Impls with state

A feature we might consider where an `impl` itself can have state.

### Generic associated types and higher-ranked types

This would be some way to express the requirement that there is a way to go from
a type to an implementation of an interface parameterized by that type.

#### Generic associated types

Generic associated types are about when this is a requirement of an interface.

#### Higher-ranked types

Higher-ranked types are used to represent this requirement in a function
signature.

### Field requirements

We might want to allow interfaces to express the requirement that any
implementing type has a particular field. This would be to match the
expressivity of inheritance, which can express "all subtypes start with this
list of fields."

### Generic type specialization

See [generic specialization](terminology.md#generic-specialization) for a
description of what this might involve.

### Bridge for C++ customization points

See details in [the goals document](goals.md#bridge-for-c-customization-points).

### Reverse generics for return types

In Rust this is
[return type of "`impl Trait`"](https://rust-lang.github.io/rfcs/1522-conservative-impl-trait.html).
In Swift,
[this feature is in discussion](https://forums.swift.org/t/improving-the-ui-of-generics/22814#heading--reverse-generics).
Swift is considering spelling this `<V: Collection> V` or `some Collection`.

### Variadic arguments

Some facility for allowing a function to generically take a variable number of
arguments.
