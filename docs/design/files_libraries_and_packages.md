## TODO

This is a skeletal design, added to support [the overview](README.md). It should
not be treated as accepted by the core team; rather, it is a placeholder until
we have more time to examine this detail. Please feel welcome to rewrite and
update as appropriate.

## Alternatives

### File extensions

The use of `6c` as a short file extension or top-level CLI (with subcommands
below it similar to `git` or `go`) has some drawbacks. There are several other
possible extensions / commands:

-   `cb`: This collides with several acronyms and may not be especially
    memorable as referring to Carbon.
-   `c6`: This seems a weird incorrect ordering of the atomic number and has a
    bad (if _extremely_ obscure) Internet slang association (NSFW, use caution
    if searching, as with too much Internet slang).
-   `carbon`: This is an obvious and unsurprising choice, but also quite long.

This seems fairly easy for us to change as we go along, but we should at some
point do a formal proposal to gather other options and let the core team try to
find the set that they feel is close enough to be a bikeshed.
