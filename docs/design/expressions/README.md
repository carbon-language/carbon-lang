## Overview

Expressions are the portions of Carbon syntax that produce values. Because types
in Carbon are values, this includes anywhere that a type is specified.

```
fn Foo(a: i32*) -> i32 {
  return *a;
}
```

Here, the parameter type `i32*`, the return type `i32`, and the operand `*a` of
the `return` statement are all expressions.

## Precedence

Expressions are interpreted based on a partial
[precedence ordering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_of_operations).
Expression components which lack a relative ordering must be disambiguated by
the developer, for example by adding parentheses; otherwise, the expression will
be invalid due to ambiguity. Precedence orderings will only be added when it's
reasonable to expect most developers to understand the precedence without
parentheses.

The precedence diagram is defined thusly:

The diagram's attributes are:

-   Each non-empty node represents a precedence group. Empty circles are used to
    simplify the graph, and do not represent a precedence group.

-   When an expression is composed from different precedence groups, the
    interpretation is determined by the precedence edges:

    -   A precedence edge A --> B means that A is lower precedence than B, so A
        can contain B without parentheses. For example, `or --> not` means that
        `not x or y` is treated as `(not x) or y`.

    -   Precedence edges are transitive. For example, `or --> == --> as` means
        that `or` is lower precedence than `as`.

-   When an expression is composed from a single precedence group, the
    interpretation is determined by the
    [associativity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operator_associativity) of the
    precedence group:

    ```mermaid
    graph TD
        non["Non-associative"]
        left>"Left associative"]
    ```

    -   For example, `+` and `-` are left-associative and in the same precedence
        group, so `a + b + c - d` is treated as `((a + b) + c) - d`.

## Names

### Unqualified names

An _unqualified name_ is a [word](../lexical_conventions/words.md) that is not a
keyword and is not preceded by a period (`.`).

**TODO:** Name lookup rules for unqualified names.

### Qualified names and member access

A _qualified name_ is a word that appears immediately after a period. Qualified
names appear in the following contexts:

-   [Designators](/docs/design/classes.md#literals): `.` _word_
-   [Simple member access expressions](member_access.md): _expression_ `.`
    _word_

```
var x: auto = {.hello = 1, .world = 2};
                ^^^^^       ^^^^^ qualified name
               ^^^^^^      ^^^^^^ designator

x.hello = x.world;
  ^^^^^     ^^^^^ qualified name
^^^^^^^   ^^^^^^^ member access expression
```

Qualified names refer to members of an entity determined by the context in which
the expression appears. For a member access, the entity is named by the
expression preceding the period. In a struct literal, the entity is the struct
type. For example:

```
package Foo api;
namespace N;
fn N.F() {}

fn G() {
  // Same as `(Foo.N).F()`.
  // `Foo.N` names namespace `N` in package `Foo`.
  // `(Foo.N).F` names function `F` in namespace `N`.
  Foo.N.F();
}

// `.n` refers to the member `n` of `{.n: i32}`.
fn H(a: {.n: i32}) -> i32 {
  // `a.n` is resolved to the member `{.n: i32}.n`,
  // and names the corresponding subobject of `a`.
  return a.n;
}

fn J() {
  // `.n` refers to the member `n of `{.n: i32}`.
  H({.n = 5 as i32});
}
```

Member access expressions associate left-to-right. If the member name is more
complex than a single _word_, a compound member access expression can be used,
with parentheses around the member name:

-   _expression_ `.` `(` _expression_ `)`

```
interface I { fn F[me: Self](); }
class X {}
external impl X as I { fn F[me: Self]() {} }

// `x.I.F()` would mean `(x.I).F()`.
fn Q(x: X) { x.(I.F)(); }
```

## Operators

Most expressions are modeled as operators:

## Conversions and casts

When an expression appears in a context in which an expression of a specific
type is expected, [implicit conversions](implicit_conversions.md) are applied to
convert the expression to the target type.

Expressions can also be converted to a specific type using an
[`as` expression](as_expressions.md).

```
fn Bar(n: i32);
fn Baz(n: i64) {
  // OK, same as Bar(n as i32)
  Bar(n);
}
```

## `if` expressions

An [`if` expression](if.md) chooses between two expressions.

```
fn Run(args: Span(StringView)) {
  var file: StringView = if args.size() > 1 then args[1] else "/dev/stdin";
}
```

`if` expressions are analogous to `?:` ternary expressions in C and C++.
