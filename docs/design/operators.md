## TODO

This is a skeletal design, added to support [the overview](README.md). It should
not be treated as accepted by the core team; rather, it is a placeholder until
we have more time to examine this detail. Please feel welcome to rewrite and
update as appropriate.

See [proposals PR 168](https://github.com/carbon-language/carbon-lang/pull/168)
for context -- that proposal may replace this.
