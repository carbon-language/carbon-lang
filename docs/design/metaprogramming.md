## TODO

This is a skeletal design, added to support [the overview](README.md). It should
not be treated as accepted by the core team; rather, it is a placeholder until
we have more time to examine this detail. Please feel welcome to rewrite and
update as appropriate.

## Overview

Carbon provides metaprogramming facilities that look similar to regular Carbon
code. These are structured, and do not offer inclusion or arbitrary
preprocessing of source text such as C/C++ does.
