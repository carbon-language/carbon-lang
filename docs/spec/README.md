Eventually, this will be the home of a formal specification for the Carbon
Language. We are committed to having a specification that is sufficiently
detailed to allow independent implementations of the language. While we plan to
have a reference implementation, we think having a specification as well is an
important tool to ensure that the behavior of the language is well understood
and holds together.

The work-in-progress specification is available here:

-   [Language specification](lang)
-   [Library specification](lib)
