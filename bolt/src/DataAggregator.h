/// DataAggregator inherits all parsing logic from DataReader as well as
/// its data structures used to represent aggregated profile data in memory.
///
/// The aggregator works by dispatching two separate perf-script jobs that
/// read perf samples and perf task annotations. Later, we read the output
/// files to extract information about which PID was used for this binary.
/// With the PID, we filter the samples and extract all LBR entries.
///
/// To aggregate LBR entries, we rely on a BinaryFunction map to locate the
/// original function where the event happened. Then, we convert a raw address
/// to an offset relative to the start of this function and aggregate branch
/// information for each function.
///
/// This must be coordinated with RewriteInstance so we have BinaryFunctions in
/// State::Disassembled. After this state, BinaryFunction will drop the
/// instruction map with original addresses we rely on to validate the traces
/// found in the LBR.
///
/// The last step is to write the aggregated data to disk in the output file
/// specified by the user.
