/// @brief Register Polly to be available as an optimizer
///
/// We currently register Polly such that it runs as early as possible. This has
/// several implications:
///
///   1) We need to schedule more canonicalization passes
///
///   As nothing is run before Polly, it is necessary to run a set of preparing
///   transformations before Polly to canonicalize the LLVM-IR and to allow
///   Polly to detect and understand the code.
///
///   2) LICM and LoopIdiom pass have not yet been run
///
///   Loop invariant code motion as well as the loop idiom recognition pass make
///   it more difficult for Polly to transform code. LICM may introduce
///   additional data dependences that are hard to eliminate and the loop idiom
///   recognition pass may introduce calls to memset that we currently do not
///   understand. By running Polly early enough (meaning before these passes) we
///   avoid difficulties that may be introduced by these passes.
///
///   3) We get the full -O3 optimization sequence after Polly
///
///   The LLVM-IR that is generated by Polly has been optimized on a high level,
///   but it may be rather inefficient on the lower/scalar level. By scheduling
///   Polly before all other passes, we have the full sequence of -O3
///   optimizations behind us, such that inefficiencies on the low level can
///   be optimized away.
