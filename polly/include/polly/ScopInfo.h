  ///
  /// We distinguish between arrays and various scalar memory objects. We use
  /// the term ``array'' to describe memory objects that consist of a set of
  /// individual data elements arranged in a multi-dimensional grid. A scalar
  /// memory object describes an individual data element and is used to model
  /// the definition and uses of llvm::Values.
  ///
  /// The polyhedral model does traditionally not reason about SSA values. To
  /// reason about llvm::Values we model them "as if" they were zero-dimensional
  /// memory objects, even though they were not actually allocated in (main)
  /// memory.  Memory for such objects is only alloca[ed] at CodeGeneration
  /// time. To relate the memory slots used during code generation with the
  /// llvm::Values they belong to the new names for these corresponding stack
  /// slots are derived by appending suffixes (currently ".s2a" and ".phiops")
  /// to the name of the original llvm::Value. To describe how def/uses are
  /// modeled exactly we use these suffixes here as well.
  ///
  /// There are currently four different kinds of memory objects:
  enum MemoryKind {
    /// MK_Array: Models a one or multi-dimensional array
    ///
    /// A memory object that can be described by a multi-dimensional array.
    /// Memory objects of this type are used to model actual multi-dimensional
    /// arrays as they exist in LLVM-IR, but they are also used to describe
    /// other objects:
    ///   - A single data element allocated on the stack using 'alloca' is
    ///     modeled as a one-dimensional, single-element array.
    ///   - A single data element allocated as a global variable is modeled as
    ///     one-dimensional, single-element array.
    ///   - Certain multi-dimensional arrays with variable size, which in
    ///     LLVM-IR are commonly expressed as a single-dimensional access with a
    ///     complicated access function, are modeled as multi-dimensional
    ///     memory objects (grep for "delinearization").
