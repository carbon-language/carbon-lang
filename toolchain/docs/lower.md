## Overview

Lowering takes the SemIR and produces LLVM IR. At present, this is done in a
single pass, although it's possible we may need to do a second pass so that we
can first generate type information for function arguments.

Lowering is done per `SemIR::InstBlock`. This minimizes changes to the
`IRBuilder` insertion point, something that is both expensive and potentially
fragile.

## Mangling

Part of lowering is choosing deterministically unique identifiers for each
lowered entity to use in platform object files. Any feature of an entity (eg:
the namespace it appears in, parameters for overloaded functions, etc) that
would create a distinct entity must be included in some way in the generated
identifier.

The current rudimentary name mangling scheme is as follows:

-   As a special case, `Main.Run` is emitted as `main`.

Otherwise the resulting name consists of:

1.  `_C`.
2.  The unqualified function name (function name mangling is the only thing
    implemented at the moment)
3.  `.`
4.  If the function being mangled is a member of:
    -   an `impl`, then add:
        1.  The implementing type, per the scope mangling.
        2.  `:`
        3.  The interface type, per the scope mangling.
    -   a type or namespace, then add:
        1.  the scope, per the scope mangling.

The scope mangling scheme is as follows:

1.  The unqualified name of the type or namespace.
2.  If the type or namespace is within another type or namespace:
    1.  `.`
    2.  The enclosing scope per the scope mangling
3.  `.`
4.  The package name.

### Examples

```carbon
package P1;
interface Interface {
  fn Op[self: Self]();
}
```

```carbon
namespace NameSpace;
class NameSpace.Implementation {
  // Mangled as:
  // `_COp.Implementation.NameSpace.Main:Interface.P1`
  impl as P1.Interface {
    fn Op[self: Self]() {
    }
  }
}
// Mangled as `main`.
fn Run() {
  var v: NameSpace.Implementation;
  v.(P1.Interface.Op)();
}
```
