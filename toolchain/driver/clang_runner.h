// Runs Clang in a similar fashion to invoking it with the provided arguments on
// the command line. We use a textual command line interface to allow easily
// incorporating custom command line flags from user invocations that we don't
// parse, but will pass transparently along to Clang itself.
//
// This doesn't literally use a subprocess to invoke Clang; it instead tries to
// directly use the Clang command line driver library. We also work to simplify
// how that driver operates and invoke it in an opinionated way to get the best
// behavior for our expected use cases in the Carbon driver:
//
// - Minimize canonicalization of file names to try to preserve the paths as
//   users type them.
// - Minimize the use of subprocess invocations which are expensive on some
//   operating systems. To the extent possible, we try to directly invoke the
//   Clang logic within this process.
// - Provide programmatic API to control defaults of Clang. For example, causing
//   verbose output.
//
// Note that this makes the current process behave like running Clang -- it uses
// standard output and standard error, and otherwise can only read and write
// files based on their names described in the arguments. It doesn't provide any
// higher-level abstraction such as streams for inputs or outputs.
