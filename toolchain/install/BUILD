# cycle. Each part of the toolchain should add the narrow data file groups to
# their data dependencies, and then use this library to locate them.

# Given a root `prefix_root`, the hierarchy looks like:
#
# - prefix_root/bin: Binaries intended for direct use.
# - prefix_root/lib/carbon: Private data and files.
# - prefix_root/lib/carbon/core: The `Core` package files.
# - prefix_root/lib/carbon/llvm/bin: LLVM binaries.
#
# This will be how installs are provided on Unix-y platforms, and is loosely
# based on the FHS (Filesystem Hierarchy Standard).
#
# TODO: For the scripts, figure out whether this is the approach we want.
# Options are:
# - Shell scripts (current): Less cross-platform and slower than alternatives.
# - Binaries: Would need to stop using `custom_malloc` to set tcmalloc in order
#   to have small binaries (~2.3 MB vs ~6 KB).
# - Symlinks: Bazel doesn't like symlinks, and we'd need to be careful to
#   resolve user-created symlinks but not Carbon-created symlinks.
