# Directory Configuration
#	This section of the Makefile determines what is where.  To be
#	specific, there are several locations that need to be defined:
#
#	o LLVM_SRC_ROOT  : The root directory of the LLVM source code.
#	o LLVM_OBJ_ROOT  : The root directory containing the built LLVM code.
#
#	o BUILD_SRC_DIR  : The directory containing the code to build.
#	o BUILD_SRC_ROOT : The root directory of the code to build.
#
#	o BUILD_OBJ_DIR  : The directory in which compiled code will be placed.
#	o BUILD_OBJ_ROOT : The root directory in which compiled code is placed.
#
