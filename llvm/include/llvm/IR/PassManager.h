/// This header defines various interfaces for pass management in LLVM. There
/// is no "pass" interface in LLVM per se. Instead, an instance of any class
/// which supports a method to 'run' it over a unit of IR can be used as
/// a pass. A pass manager is generally a tool to collect a sequence of passes
/// which run over a particular IR construct, and run each of them in sequence
/// over each such construct in the containing IR construct. As there is no
/// containing IR construct for a Module, a manager for passes over modules
/// forms the base case which runs its managed passes in sequence over the
/// single module provided.
///
/// The core IR library provides managers for running passes over
/// modules and functions.
///
/// * FunctionPassManager can run over a Module, runs each pass over
///   a Function.
/// * ModulePassManager must be directly run, runs each pass over the Module.
///
/// Note that the implementations of the pass managers use concept-based
/// polymorphism as outlined in the "Value Semantics and Concept-based
/// Polymorphism" talk (or its abbreviated sibling "Inheritance Is The Base
/// Class of Evil") by Sean Parent:

/// A special type used to provide an address that identifies a set of related
/// analyses.
///
/// These sets are primarily used below to mark sets of analyses as preserved.
/// An example would be analyses depending only on the CFG of a function.
/// A transformation can mark that it is preserving the CFG of a function and
/// then analyses can check for this rather than each transform having to fully
/// enumerate every analysis preserved.
struct alignas(8) AnalysisSetKey {};

/// Class for tracking what analyses are preserved after a transformation pass
/// runs over some unit of IR.
///
/// Transformation passes build and return these objects when run over the IR
/// to communicate which analyses remain valid afterward. For most passes this
/// is fairly simple: if they don't change anything all analyses are preserved,
/// otherwise only a short list of analyses that have been explicitly updated
/// are preserved.
///
/// This class also provides the ability to mark abstract *sets* of analyses as
/// preserved. These sets allow passes to indicate that they preserve broad
/// aspects of the IR (such as its CFG) and analyses to opt in to that being
/// sufficient without the passes having to fully enumerate such analyses.
///
/// Finally, this class can represent "abandoning" an analysis, which marks it
/// as not-preserved even if it would be covered by some abstract set of
/// analyses.
///
/// Given a `PreservedAnalyses` object, an analysis will typically want to
/// figure out whether it is preserved. In the example below, MyAnalysisType is
/// preserved if it's not abandoned, and (a) it's explicitly marked as
/// preserved, (b), the set AllAnalysesOn<MyIRUnit> is preserved, or (c) both
