/// This header defines various interfaces for pass management in LLVM. There
/// is no "pass" interface in LLVM per se. Instead, an instance of any class
/// which supports a method to 'run' it over a unit of IR can be used as
/// a pass. A pass manager is generally a tool to collect a sequence of passes
/// which run over a particular IR construct, and run each of them in sequence
/// over each such construct in the containing IR construct. As there is no
/// containing IR construct for a Module, a manager for passes over modules
/// forms the base case which runs its managed passes in sequence over the
/// single module provided.
///
/// The core IR library provides managers for running passes over
/// modules and functions.
///
/// * FunctionPassManager can run over a Module, runs each pass over
///   a Function.
/// * ModulePassManager must be directly run, runs each pass over the Module.
///
/// Note that the implementations of the pass managers use concept-based
/// polymorphism as outlined in the "Value Semantics and Concept-based
/// Polymorphism" talk (or its abbreviated sibling "Inheritance Is The Base
/// Class of Evil") by Sean Parent:
