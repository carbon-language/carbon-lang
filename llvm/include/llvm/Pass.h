//
// This file defines a base class that indicates that a specified class is a
// transformation pass implementation.
//
// Passes are designed this way so that it is possible to run passes in a cache
// and organizationally optimal order without having to specify it at the front
// end.  This allows arbitrary passes to be strung together and have them
// executed as effeciently as possible.
//
// Passes should extend one of the classes below, depending on the guarantees
// that it can make about what will be modified as it is run.  For example, most
// global optimizations should derive from FunctionPass, because they do not add
// or delete functions, they operate on the internals of the function.
//
// Note that this file #includes PassSupport.h and PassAnalysisSupport.h (at the
// bottom), so the APIs exposed by these files are also automatically available
// to all users of this file.
