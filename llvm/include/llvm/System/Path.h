  /// This class provides an abstraction for the path to a file or directory

  /// or directory which may or may not be valid for a given machine's file
  /// system. The class is patterned after the java.io.File class with various
  /// extensions and several omissions (not relevant to LLVM).  A Path object
  /// ensures that the path it encapsulates is syntactically valid for the
  /// operating system it is running on but does not ensure correctness for
  /// any particular file system. That is, a syntactically valid path might
  /// specify path components that do not exist in the file system and using
  /// such a Path to act on the file system could produce errors. There is one
  /// invalid Path value which is permitted: the empty path.  The class should
  /// never allow a syntactically invalid non-empty path name to be assigned.
  /// Empty paths are required in order to indicate an error result in some
  /// situations. If the path is empty, the isValid operation will return
  /// false. All operations will fail if isValid is false. Operations that
  /// change the path will either return false if it would cause a syntactically
  /// invalid path name (in which case the Path object is left unchanged) or
  /// throw an std::string exception indicating the error. The methods are
  /// grouped into four basic categories: Path Accessors (provide information
  /// about the path without accessing disk), Disk Accessors (provide
  /// information about the underlying file or directory), Path Mutators
  /// (change the path information, not the disk), and Disk Mutators (change
