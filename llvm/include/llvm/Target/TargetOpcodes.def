/// KILL - This instruction is a noop that is used only to adjust the
/// liveness of registers. This can be useful when dealing with
/// sub-registers.
HANDLE_TARGET_OPCODE(KILL, 5)

/// EXTRACT_SUBREG - This instruction takes two operands: a register
/// that has subregisters, and a subregister index. It returns the
/// extracted subregister value. This is commonly used to implement
/// truncation operations on target architectures which support it.
HANDLE_TARGET_OPCODE(EXTRACT_SUBREG, 6)

/// INSERT_SUBREG - This instruction takes three operands: a register that
/// has subregisters, a register providing an insert value, and a
/// subregister index. It returns the value of the first register with the
/// value of the second register inserted. The first register is often
/// defined by an IMPLICIT_DEF, because it is commonly used to implement
/// anyext operations on target architectures which support it.
HANDLE_TARGET_OPCODE(INSERT_SUBREG, 7)

/// IMPLICIT_DEF - This is the MachineInstr-level equivalent of undef.
HANDLE_TARGET_OPCODE(IMPLICIT_DEF, 8)

/// SUBREG_TO_REG - This instruction is similar to INSERT_SUBREG except that
/// the first operand is an immediate integer constant. This constant is
/// often zero, because it is commonly used to assert that the instruction
/// defining the register implicitly clears the high bits.
HANDLE_TARGET_OPCODE(SUBREG_TO_REG, 9)

/// COPY_TO_REGCLASS - This instruction is a placeholder for a plain
/// register-to-register copy into a specific register class. This is only
/// used between instruction selection and MachineInstr creation, before
/// virtual registers have been created for all the instructions, and it's
/// only needed in cases where the register classes implied by the
/// instructions are insufficient. It is emitted as a COPY MachineInstr.
HANDLE_TARGET_OPCODE(COPY_TO_REGCLASS, 10)

/// DBG_VALUE - a mapping of the llvm.dbg.value intrinsic
HANDLE_TARGET_OPCODE(DBG_VALUE, 11)

/// REG_SEQUENCE - This variadic instruction is used to form a register that
/// represents a consecutive sequence of sub-registers. It's used as a
/// register coalescing / allocation aid and must be eliminated before code
/// emission.
// In SDNode form, the first operand encodes the register class created by
// the REG_SEQUENCE, while each subsequent pair names a vreg + subreg index
// pair.  Once it has been lowered to a MachineInstr, the regclass operand
// is no longer present.
/// e.g. v1027 = REG_SEQUENCE v1024, 3, v1025, 4, v1026, 5
/// After register coalescing references of v1024 should be replace with
/// v1027:3, v1025 with v1027:4, etc.
HANDLE_TARGET_OPCODE(REG_SEQUENCE, 12)

/// COPY - Target-independent register copy. This instruction can also be
/// used to copy between subregisters of virtual registers.
HANDLE_TARGET_OPCODE(COPY, 13)

/// BUNDLE - This instruction represents an instruction bundle. Instructions
/// which immediately follow a BUNDLE instruction which are marked with
/// 'InsideBundle' flag are inside the bundle.

/// Lifetime markers.
HANDLE_TARGET_OPCODE(LIFETIME_START, 15)

/// A Stackmap instruction captures the location of live variables at its
/// position in the instruction stream. It is followed by a shadow of bytes
/// that must lie within the function and not contain another stackmap.
HANDLE_TARGET_OPCODE(STACKMAP, 17)

/// Patchable call instruction - this instruction represents a call to a
/// constant address, followed by a series of NOPs. It is intended to
/// support optimizations for dynamic languages (such as javascript) that
/// rewrite calls to runtimes with more efficient code sequences.
/// This also implies a stack map.
HANDLE_TARGET_OPCODE(PATCHPOINT, 18)

/// This pseudo-instruction loads the stack guard value. Targets which need
/// to prevent the stack guard value or address from being spilled to the
/// stack should override TargetLowering::emitLoadStackGuardNode and
/// additionally expand this pseudo after register allocation.
HANDLE_TARGET_OPCODE(LOAD_STACK_GUARD, 19)

/// Call instruction with associated vm state for deoptimization and list
/// of live pointers for relocation by the garbage collector.  It is
/// intended to support garbage collection with fully precise relocating
/// collectors and deoptimizations in either the callee or caller.
HANDLE_TARGET_OPCODE(STATEPOINT, 20)

/// Instruction that records the offset of a local stack allocation passed to
/// llvm.localescape. It has two arguments: the symbol for the label and the
/// frame index of the local stack allocation.
HANDLE_TARGET_OPCODE(LOCAL_ESCAPE, 21)

/// Loading instruction that may page fault, bundled with associated
/// information on how to handle such a page fault.  It is intended to support
/// "zero cost" null checks in managed languages by allowing LLVM to fold
/// comparisons into existing memory operations.
HANDLE_TARGET_OPCODE(FAULTING_LOAD_OP, 22)

/// Wraps a machine instruction to add patchability constraints.  An
/// instruction wrapped in PATCHABLE_OP has to either have a minimum
/// size or be preceded with a nop of that size.  The first operand is
/// an immediate denoting the minimum size of the instruction, the
/// second operand is an immediate denoting the opcode of the original
/// instruction.  The rest of the operands are the operands of the
/// original instruction.
HANDLE_TARGET_OPCODE(PATCHABLE_OP, 23)

/// This is a marker instruction which gets translated into a nop sled, useful
/// for inserting instrumentation instructions at runtime.
HANDLE_TARGET_OPCODE(PATCHABLE_FUNCTION_ENTER, 24)

/// Wraps a return instruction and its operands to enable adding nop sleds
/// either before or after the return. The nop sleds are useful for inserting
/// instrumentation instructions at runtime.
HANDLE_TARGET_OPCODE(PATCHABLE_RET, 25)

/// The following generic opcodes are not supposed to appear after ISel.
/// This is something we might want to relax, but for now, this is convenient
/// to produce diagnostics.

/// Generic ADD instruction. This is an integer add.
HANDLE_TARGET_OPCODE(G_ADD, 26)
HANDLE_TARGET_OPCODE_MARKER(PRE_ISEL_GENERIC_OPCODE_START, G_ADD)

/// Generic Bitwise-OR instruction.

/// Generic BRANCH instruction. This is an unconditional branch.
HANDLE_TARGET_OPCODE(G_BR, 28)

// TODO: Add more generic opcodes as we move along.

/// Marker for the end of the generic opcode.
/// This is used to check if an opcode is in the range of the
/// generic opcodes.
