<div class="doc_text">

<p>Welcome to Chapter 6 of the "<a href="index.html">Implementing a language
with LLVM</a>" tutorial.  At this point in our tutorial, we now have a fully
functional language that is fairly minimal, but also useful.  There
is still one big problem with it, however. Our language doesn't have many
useful operators (like division, logical negation, or even any comparisons
besides less-than).</p>

<p>This chapter of the tutorial takes a wild digression into adding user-defined
operators to the simple and beautiful Kaleidoscope language. This digression now
gives us a simple and ugly language in some ways, but also a powerful one at the
same time.  One of the great things about creating your own language is that you
get to decide what is good or bad.  In this tutorial we'll assume that it is
okay to use this as a way to show some interesting parsing techniques.</p>

<p>At the end of this tutorial, we'll run through an example Kaleidoscope
application that <a href="#example">renders the Mandelbrot set</a>.  This gives
an example of what you can build with Kaleidoscope and its feature set.</p>

</div>

<div class="doc_text">

<p>
The "operator overloading" that we will add to Kaleidoscope is more general than
languages like C++.  In C++, you are only allowed to redefine existing
operators: you can't programatically change the grammar, introduce new
operators, change precedence levels, etc.  In this chapter, we will add this
capability to Kaleidoscope, which will let the user round out the set of
operators that are supported.</p>

<p>The point of going into user-defined operators in a tutorial like this is to
show the power and flexibility of using a hand-written parser.  Thus far, the parser
we have been implementing uses recursive descent for most parts of the grammar and
operator precedence parsing for the expressions.  See <a
href="OCamlLangImpl2.html">Chapter 2</a> for details.  Without using operator
precedence parsing, it would be very difficult to allow the programmer to
introduce new operators into the grammar: the grammar is dynamically extensible
as the JIT runs.</p>

<p>The two specific features we'll add are programmable unary operators (right
now, Kaleidoscope has no unary operators at all) as well as binary operators.
An example of this is:</p>

<div class="doc_code">
<pre>
# Logical unary not.
def unary!(v)
  if v then
    0
  else
    1;

# Define &gt; with the same precedence as &lt;.
def binary&gt; 10 (LHS RHS)
  RHS &lt; LHS;

# Binary "logical or", (note that it does not "short circuit")
def binary| 5 (LHS RHS)
  if LHS then
    1
  else if RHS then
    1
  else
    0;

# Define = with slightly lower precedence than relationals.
def binary= 9 (LHS RHS)
  !(LHS &lt; RHS | LHS &gt; RHS);
</pre>
</div>

<p>Many languages aspire to being able to implement their standard runtime
library in the language itself.  In Kaleidoscope, we can implement significant
parts of the language in the library!</p>

<p>We will break down implementation of these features into two parts:
implementing support for user-defined binary operators and adding unary
operators.</p>

</div>

<!-- *********************************************************************** -->
<div class="doc_section"><a name="binary">User-defined Binary Operators</a></div>
<!-- *********************************************************************** -->

<div class="doc_text">

<p>Adding support for user-defined binary operators is pretty simple with our
current framework.  We'll first add support for the unary/binary keywords:</p>

<div class="doc_code">
<pre>
type token =
  ...
  <b>(* operators *)
  | Binary | Unary</b>

...

and lex_ident buffer = parser
  ...
      | "for" -&gt; [&lt; 'Token.For; stream &gt;]
      | "in" -&gt; [&lt; 'Token.In; stream &gt;]
      <b>| "binary" -&gt; [&lt; 'Token.Binary; stream &gt;]
      | "unary" -&gt; [&lt; 'Token.Unary; stream &gt;]</b>
</pre>
</div>

<p>This just adds lexer support for the unary and binary keywords, like we
did in <a href="OCamlLangImpl5.html#iflexer">previous chapters</a>.  One nice
thing about our current AST, is that we represent binary operators with full
generalisation by using their ASCII code as the opcode.  For our extended
operators, we'll use this same representation, so we don't need any new AST or
parser support.</p>

<p>On the other hand, we have to be able to represent the definitions of these
new operators, in the "def binary| 5" part of the function definition.  In our
grammar so far, the "name" for the function definition is parsed as the
"prototype" production and into the <tt>Ast.Prototype</tt> AST node.  To
represent our new user-defined operators as prototypes, we have to extend
the  <tt>Ast.Prototype</tt> AST node like this:</p>

<div class="doc_code">
<pre>
(* proto - This type represents the "prototype" for a function, which captures
 * its name, and its argument names (thus implicitly the number of arguments the
 * function takes). *)
type proto =
  | Prototype of string * string array
  <b>| BinOpPrototype of string * string array * int</b>
</pre>
</div>

<p>Basically, in addition to knowing a name for the prototype, we now keep track
of whether it was an operator, and if it was, what precedence level the operator
is at.  The precedence is only used for binary operators (as you'll see below,
it just doesn't apply for unary operators).  Now that we have a way to represent
the prototype for a user-defined operator, we need to parse it:</p>

<div class="doc_code">
<pre>
(* prototype
 *   ::= id '(' id* ')'
 <b>*   ::= binary LETTER number? (id, id)
 *   ::= unary LETTER number? (id) *)</b>
let parse_prototype =
  let rec parse_args accumulator = parser
    | [&lt; 'Token.Ident id; e=parse_args (id::accumulator) &gt;] -&gt; e
    | [&lt; &gt;] -&gt; accumulator
  in
  let parse_operator = parser
    | [&lt; 'Token.Unary &gt;] -&gt; "unary", 1
    | [&lt; 'Token.Binary &gt;] -&gt; "binary", 2
  in
  let parse_binary_precedence = parser
    | [&lt; 'Token.Number n &gt;] -&gt; int_of_float n
    | [&lt; &gt;] -&gt; 30
  in
  parser
  | [&lt; 'Token.Ident id;
       'Token.Kwd '(' ?? "expected '(' in prototype";
       args=parse_args [];
       'Token.Kwd ')' ?? "expected ')' in prototype" &gt;] -&gt;
      (* success. *)
      Ast.Prototype (id, Array.of_list (List.rev args))
  <b>| [&lt; (prefix, kind)=parse_operator;
       'Token.Kwd op ?? "expected an operator";
       (* Read the precedence if present. *)
       binary_precedence=parse_binary_precedence;
       'Token.Kwd '(' ?? "expected '(' in prototype";
        args=parse_args [];
       'Token.Kwd ')' ?? "expected ')' in prototype" &gt;] -&gt;
      let name = prefix ^ (String.make 1 op) in
      let args = Array.of_list (List.rev args) in

      (* Verify right number of arguments for operator. *)
      if Array.length args != kind
      then raise (Stream.Error "invalid number of operands for operator")
      else
        if kind == 1 then
          Ast.Prototype (name, args)
        else
          Ast.BinOpPrototype (name, args, binary_precedence)</b>
  | [&lt; &gt;] -&gt;
      raise (Stream.Error "expected function name in prototype")
</pre>
</div>

<p>This is all fairly straightforward parsing code, and we have already seen
a lot of similar code in the past.  One interesting part about the code above is
the couple lines that set up <tt>name</tt> for binary operators.  This builds
names like "binary@" for a newly defined "@" operator.  This then takes
advantage of the fact that symbol names in the LLVM symbol table are allowed to
have any character in them, including embedded nul characters.</p>

<p>The next interesting thing to add, is codegen support for these binary
operators.  Given our current structure, this is a simple addition of a default
case for our existing binary operator node:</p>

<div class="doc_code">
<pre>
let codegen_expr = function
  ...
  | Ast.Binary (op, lhs, rhs) -&gt;
      let lhs_val = codegen_expr lhs in
      let rhs_val = codegen_expr rhs in
      begin
        match op with
        | '+' -&gt; build_add lhs_val rhs_val "addtmp" builder
        | '-' -&gt; build_sub lhs_val rhs_val "subtmp" builder
        | '*' -&gt; build_mul lhs_val rhs_val "multmp" builder
        | '&lt;' -&gt;
            (* Convert bool 0/1 to double 0.0 or 1.0 *)
            let i = build_fcmp Fcmp.Ult lhs_val rhs_val "cmptmp" builder in
            build_uitofp i double_type "booltmp" builder
        <b>| _ -&gt;
            (* If it wasn't a builtin binary operator, it must be a user defined
             * one. Emit a call to it. *)
            let callee = "binary" ^ (String.make 1 op) in
            let callee =
              match lookup_function callee the_module with
              | Some callee -&gt; callee
              | None -&gt; raise (Error "binary operator not found!")
            in
            build_call callee [|lhs_val; rhs_val|] "binop" builder</b>
      end
</pre>
</div>

<p>As you can see above, the new code is actually really simple.  It just does
a lookup for the appropriate operator in the symbol table and generates a
function call to it.  Since user-defined operators are just built as normal
functions (because the "prototype" boils down to a function with the right
name) everything falls into place.</p>

<p>The final piece of code we are missing, is a bit of top level magic:</p>

<div class="doc_code">
<pre>
let codegen_func the_fpm = function
  | Ast.Function (proto, body) -&gt;
      Hashtbl.clear named_values;
      let the_function = codegen_proto proto in

      <b>(* If this is an operator, install it. *)
      begin match proto with
      | Ast.BinOpPrototype (name, args, prec) -&gt;
          let op = name.[String.length name - 1] in
          Hashtbl.add Parser.binop_precedence op prec;
      | _ -&gt; ()
      end;</b>

      (* Create a new basic block to start insertion into. *)
      let bb = append_block "entry" the_function in
      position_at_end bb builder;
      ...
</pre>
</div>

<p>Basically, before codegening a function, if it is a user-defined operator, we
register it in the precedence table.  This allows the binary operator parsing
logic we already have in place to handle it.  Since we are working on a
fully-general operator precedence parser, this is all we need to do to "extend
the grammar".</p>

<p>Now we have useful user-defined binary operators.  This builds a lot
on the previous framework we built for other operators.  Adding unary operators
is a bit more challenging, because we don't have any framework for it yet - lets
see what it takes.</p>

</div>

<!-- *********************************************************************** -->
<div class="doc_section"><a name="unary">User-defined Unary Operators</a></div>
<!-- *********************************************************************** -->

<div class="doc_text">

<p>Since we don't currently support unary operators in the Kaleidoscope
language, we'll need to add everything to support them.  Above, we added simple
support for the 'unary' keyword to the lexer.  In addition to that, we need an
AST node:</p>

<div class="doc_code">
<pre>
type expr =
  ...
  (* variant for a unary operator. *)
  | Unary of char * expr
  ...
</pre>
</div>

<p>This AST node is very simple and obvious by now.  It directly mirrors the
binary operator AST node, except that it only has one child.  With this, we
need to add the parsing logic.  Parsing a unary operator is pretty simple: we'll
add a new function to do it:</p>

<div class="doc_code">
<pre>
(* unary
 *   ::= primary
 *   ::= '!' unary *)
and parse_unary = parser
  (* If this is a unary operator, read it. *)
  | [&lt; 'Token.Kwd op when op != '(' &amp;&amp; op != ')'; operand=parse_expr &gt;] -&gt;
      Ast.Unary (op, operand)

  (* If the current token is not an operator, it must be a primary expr. *)
  | [&lt; stream &gt;] -&gt; parse_primary stream
</pre>
</div>

<p>The grammar we add is pretty straightforward here.  If we see a unary
operator when parsing a primary operator, we eat the operator as a prefix and
parse the remaining piece as another unary operator.  This allows us to handle
multiple unary operators (e.g. "!!x").  Note that unary operators can't have
ambiguous parses like binary operators can, so there is no need for precedence
information.</p>

<p>The problem with this function, is that we need to call ParseUnary from
somewhere.  To do this, we change previous callers of ParsePrimary to call
<tt>parse_unary</tt> instead:</p>

<div class="doc_code">
<pre>
(* binoprhs
 *   ::= ('+' primary)* *)
and parse_bin_rhs expr_prec lhs stream =
        ...
        <b>(* Parse the unary expression after the binary operator. *)
        let rhs = parse_unary stream in</b>
        ...

...

(* expression
 *   ::= primary binoprhs *)
and parse_expr = parser
  | [&lt; lhs=<b>parse_unary</b>; stream &gt;] -&gt; parse_bin_rhs 0 lhs stream
</pre>
</div>

<p>With these two simple changes, we are now able to parse unary operators and build the
AST for them.  Next up, we need to add parser support for prototypes, to parse
the unary operator prototype.  We extend the binary operator code above
with:</p>

<div class="doc_code">
<pre>
(* prototype
 *   ::= id '(' id* ')'
 *   ::= binary LETTER number? (id, id)
 <b>*   ::= unary LETTER number? (id)</b> *)
let parse_prototype =
  let rec parse_args accumulator = parser
    | [&lt; 'Token.Ident id; e=parse_args (id::accumulator) &gt;] -&gt; e
    | [&lt; &gt;] -&gt; accumulator
  in
  <b>let parse_operator = parser
    | [&lt; 'Token.Unary &gt;] -&gt; "unary", 1
    | [&lt; 'Token.Binary &gt;] -&gt; "binary", 2
  in</b>
  let parse_binary_precedence = parser
    | [&lt; 'Token.Number n &gt;] -&gt; int_of_float n
    | [&lt; &gt;] -&gt; 30
  in
  parser
  | [&lt; 'Token.Ident id;
       'Token.Kwd '(' ?? "expected '(' in prototype";
       args=parse_args [];
       'Token.Kwd ')' ?? "expected ')' in prototype" &gt;] -&gt;
      (* success. *)
      Ast.Prototype (id, Array.of_list (List.rev args))
  <b>| [&lt; (prefix, kind)=parse_operator;
       'Token.Kwd op ?? "expected an operator";
       (* Read the precedence if present. *)
       binary_precedence=parse_binary_precedence;
       'Token.Kwd '(' ?? "expected '(' in prototype";
        args=parse_args [];
       'Token.Kwd ')' ?? "expected ')' in prototype" &gt;] -&gt;
      let name = prefix ^ (String.make 1 op) in
      let args = Array.of_list (List.rev args) in

      (* Verify right number of arguments for operator. *)
      if Array.length args != kind
      then raise (Stream.Error "invalid number of operands for operator")
      else
        if kind == 1 then
          Ast.Prototype (name, args)
        else
          Ast.BinOpPrototype (name, args, binary_precedence)</b>
  | [&lt; &gt;] -&gt;
      raise (Stream.Error "expected function name in prototype")
</pre>
</div>

<p>As with binary operators, we name unary operators with a name that includes
the operator character.  This assists us at code generation time.  Speaking of,
the final piece we need to add is codegen support for unary operators.  It looks
like this:</p>

<div class="doc_code">
<pre>
let rec codegen_expr = function
  ...
  | Ast.Unary (op, operand) -&gt;
      let operand = codegen_expr operand in
      let callee = "unary" ^ (String.make 1 op) in
      let callee =
        match lookup_function callee the_module with
        | Some callee -&gt; callee
        | None -&gt; raise (Error "unknown unary operator")
      in
      build_call callee [|operand|] "unop" builder
</pre>
</div>

<p>This code is similar to, but simpler than, the code for binary operators.  It
is simpler primarily because it doesn't need to handle any predefined operators.
</p>

</div>

<!-- *********************************************************************** -->
<div class="doc_section"><a name="example">Kicking the Tires</a></div>
<!-- *********************************************************************** -->

<div class="doc_text">

<p>It is somewhat hard to believe, but with a few simple extensions we've
covered in the last chapters, we have grown a real-ish language.  With this, we
can do a lot of interesting things, including I/O, math, and a bunch of other
things.  For example, we can now add a nice sequencing operator (printd is
defined to print out the specified value and a newline):</p>

<div class="doc_code">
<pre>
ready&gt; <b>extern printd(x);</b>
Read extern: declare double @printd(double)
ready&gt; <b>def binary : 1 (x y) 0;  # Low-precedence operator that ignores operands.</b>
..
ready&gt; <b>printd(123) : printd(456) : printd(789);</b>
123.000000
456.000000
789.000000
Evaluated to 0.000000
</pre>
</div>

<p>We can also define a bunch of other "primitive" operations, such as:</p>

<div class="doc_code">
<pre>
# Logical unary not.
def unary!(v)
  if v then
    0
  else
    1;

# Unary negate.
def unary-(v)
  0-v;

# Define &gt; with the same precedence as &gt;.
def binary&gt; 10 (LHS RHS)
  RHS &lt; LHS;

# Binary logical or, which does not short circuit.
def binary| 5 (LHS RHS)
  if LHS then
    1
  else if RHS then
    1
  else
    0;

# Binary logical and, which does not short circuit.
def binary&amp; 6 (LHS RHS)
  if !LHS then
    0
  else
    !!RHS;

# Define = with slightly lower precedence than relationals.
def binary = 9 (LHS RHS)
  !(LHS &lt; RHS | LHS &gt; RHS);

</pre>
</div>


<p>Given the previous if/then/else support, we can also define interesting
functions for I/O.  For example, the following prints out a character whose
"density" reflects the value passed in: the lower the value, the denser the
character:</p>

<div class="doc_code">
<pre>
ready&gt;
<b>
extern putchard(char)
def printdensity(d)
  if d &gt; 8 then
    putchard(32)  # ' '
  else if d &gt; 4 then
    putchard(46)  # '.'
  else if d &gt; 2 then
    putchard(43)  # '+'
  else
    putchard(42); # '*'</b>
...
ready&gt; <b>printdensity(1): printdensity(2): printdensity(3) :
          printdensity(4): printdensity(5): printdensity(9): putchard(10);</b>
*++..
Evaluated to 0.000000
</pre>
</div>

<p>Based on these simple primitive operations, we can start to define more
interesting things.  For example, here's a little function that solves for the
number of iterations it takes a function in the complex plane to
converge:</p>

<div class="doc_code">
<pre>
# determine whether the specific location diverges.
# Solve for z = z^2 + c in the complex plane.
def mandleconverger(real imag iters creal cimag)
  if iters &gt; 255 | (real*real + imag*imag &gt; 4) then
    iters
  else
    mandleconverger(real*real - imag*imag + creal,
                    2*real*imag + cimag,
                    iters+1, creal, cimag);

# return the number of iterations required for the iteration to escape
def mandleconverge(real imag)
  mandleconverger(real, imag, 0, real, imag);
</pre>
</div>

<p>This "z = z<sup>2</sup> + c" function is a beautiful little creature that is the basis
for computation of the <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandelbrot_set">Mandelbrot Set</a>.  Our
<tt>mandelconverge</tt> function returns the number of iterations that it takes
for a complex orbit to escape, saturating to 255.  This is not a very useful
function by itself, but if you plot its value over a two-dimensional plane,
you can see the Mandelbrot set.  Given that we are limited to using putchard
here, our amazing graphical output is limited, but we can whip together
something using the density plotter above:</p>

<div class="doc_code">
<pre>
# compute and plot the mandlebrot set with the specified 2 dimensional range
# info.
def mandelhelp(xmin xmax xstep   ymin ymax ystep)
  for y = ymin, y &lt; ymax, ystep in (
    (for x = xmin, x &lt; xmax, xstep in
       printdensity(mandleconverge(x,y)))
    : putchard(10)
  )

# mandel - This is a convenient helper function for ploting the mandelbrot set
# from the specified position with the specified Magnification.
def mandel(realstart imagstart realmag imagmag)
  mandelhelp(realstart, realstart+realmag*78, realmag,
             imagstart, imagstart+imagmag*40, imagmag);
</pre>
</div>

<p>Given this, we can try plotting out the mandlebrot set!  Lets try it out:</p>

<div class="doc_code">
<pre>
ready&gt; <b>mandel(-2.3, -1.3, 0.05, 0.07);</b>

<p>At this point, you may be starting to realize that Kaleidoscope is a real
and powerful language.  It may not be self-similar :), but it can be used to
plot things that are!</p>

<p>With this, we conclude the "adding user-defined operators" chapter of the
tutorial.  We have successfully augmented our language, adding the ability to
extend the language in the library, and we have shown how this can be used to
build a simple but interesting end-user application in Kaleidoscope.  At this
point, Kaleidoscope can build a variety of applications that are functional and
can call functions with side-effects, but it can't actually define and mutate a
variable itself.</p>

<p>Strikingly, variable mutation is an important feature of some
languages, and it is not at all obvious how to <a href="OCamlLangImpl7.html">add
support for mutable variables</a> without having to add an "SSA construction"
phase to your front-end.  In the next chapter, we will describe how you can
add variable mutation without building SSA in your front-end.</p>
