Overview
========

.. warning::

   If you are using a released version of LLVM, see `the download page
   <http://llvm.org/releases/>`_ to find your documentation.

The LLVM compiler infrastructure supports a wide range of projects, from
industrial strength compilers to specialized JIT applications to small
research projects.

Similarly, documentation is broken down into several high-level groupings
targeted at different audiences:

LLVM Design & Overview
======================

Several introductory papers and presentations.

User Guides
===========

For those new to the LLVM system.

NOTE: If you are a user who is only interested in using LLVM-based
compilers, you should look into `Clang <http://clang.llvm.org>`_ or
`DragonEgg <http://dragonegg.llvm.org>`_ instead. The documentation here is
intended for users who have a need to work with the intermediate LLVM
representation.

Community
=========

LLVM has a thriving community of friendly and helpful developers.
The two primary communication mechanisms in the LLVM community are mailing
lists and IRC.

Mailing Lists
-------------

If you can't find what you need in these docs, try consulting the mailing
lists.

`Developer's List`__
  This list is for people who want to be included in technical discussions of
  LLVM. People post to this list when they have questions about writing code
  for or using the LLVM tools. It is relatively low volume.

  .. __: http://lists.cs.uiuc.edu/mailman/listinfo/llvmdev

`Commits Archive`__
  This list contains all commit messages that are made when LLVM developers
  commit code changes to the repository. It is useful for those who want to
  stay on the bleeding edge of LLVM development. This list is very high volume.

  .. __: http://lists.cs.uiuc.edu/pipermail/llvm-commits/

`Bugs & Patches Archive`__
  This list gets emailed every time a bug is opened and closed, and when people
  submit patches to be included in LLVM.  It is higher volume than the LLVMdev
  list.

  .. __: http://lists.cs.uiuc.edu/pipermail/llvmbugs/

`Test Results Archive`__
  A message is automatically sent to this list by every active nightly tester
  when it completes.  As such, this list gets email several times each day,
  making it a high volume list.

  .. __: http://lists.cs.uiuc.edu/pipermail/llvm-testresults/

`LLVM Announcements List`__
  This is a low volume list that provides important announcements regarding
  LLVM.  It gets email about once a month.

  .. __: http://lists.cs.uiuc.edu/mailman/listinfo/llvm-announce

IRC
---

Users and developers of the LLVM project (including subprojects such as Clang)
can be found in #llvm on `irc.oftc.net <irc://irc.oftc.net/llvm>`_.

This channel has several bots.

* Buildbot reporters

  * llvmbb - Bot for the main LLVM buildbot master.
    http://lab.llvm.org:8011/console
  * bb-chapuni - An individually run buildbot master. http://bb.pgr.jp/console
  * smooshlab - Apple's internal buildbot master.

* robot - Bugzilla linker. %bug <number>

* clang-bot - A `geordi <http://www.eelis.net/geordi/>`_ instance running
  near-trunk clang instead of gcc.
