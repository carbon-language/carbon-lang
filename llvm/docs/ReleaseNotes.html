<div class="doc_text">
<p>
The LLVM 2.9 distribution currently consists of code from the core LLVM
repository (which roughly includes the LLVM optimizers, code generators
and supporting tools), the Clang repository and the llvm-gcc repository.  In
addition to this code, the LLVM Project includes other sub-projects that are in
development.  Here we include updates on these subprojects.
</p>

</div>


<!--=========================================================================-->
<h2>
<a name="clang">Clang: C/C++/Objective-C Frontend Toolkit</a>
</h2>

<div class="doc_text">

<p><a href="http://clang.llvm.org/">Clang</a> is an LLVM front end for the C,
C++, and Objective-C languages. Clang aims to provide a better user experience
through expressive diagnostics, a high level of conformance to language
standards, fast compilation, and low memory use. Like LLVM, Clang provides a
modular, library-based architecture that makes it suitable for creating or
integrating with other development tools. Clang is considered a
production-quality compiler for C, Objective-C, C++ and Objective-C++ on x86
(32- and 64-bit), and for darwin/arm targets.</p>

<p>In the LLVM 2.9 time-frame, the Clang team has made many improvements in C,
C++ and Objective-C support.  C++ support is now generally rock solid, has
been exercised on a broad variety of code, and has several new <a 
href="http://clang.llvm.org/cxx_status.html#cxx0x">C++'0x features</a>
implemented (such as rvalue references and variadic templates).  LLVM 2.9 has
also brought in a large range of bug fixes and minor features (e.g. __label__
support), and is much more compatible with the Linux Kernel.</p>  
  
<p>If Clang rejects your code that is built with another compiler, please take a
look at the <a href="http://clang.llvm.org/compatibility.html">language
compatibility</a> guide to make sure the issue isn't intentional or a known
issue.

<h2>
<a name="dragonegg">DragonEgg: GCC front-ends, LLVM back-end</a>
</h2>

<div class="doc_text">
<p>
<a href="http://dragonegg.llvm.org/">DragonEgg</a> is a
<a href="http://gcc.gnu.org/wiki/plugins">gcc plugin</a> that replaces GCC's
optimizers and code generators with LLVM's.
Currently it requires a patched version of gcc-4.5.
The plugin can target the x86-32 and x86-64 processor families and has been
used successfully on the Darwin, FreeBSD and Linux platforms.
The Ada, C, C++ and Fortran languages work well.
The plugin is capable of compiling plenty of Obj-C, Obj-C++ and Java but it is
not known whether the compiled code actually works or not!
</p>

<p>
The 2.9 release has the following notable changes:
<ul>
<li>The plugin is much more stable when compiling Fortran.</li>
<li>Inline assembly where an asm output is tied to an input of a different size
is now supported in many more cases.</li>
<li>Basic support for the __float128 type was added.  It is now possible to
generate LLVM IR from programs using __float128 but code generation does not
work yet.</li>
<li>Compiling Java programs no longer systematically crashes the plugin.</li>
</ul>

<h2>
<a name="compiler-rt">compiler-rt: Compiler Runtime Library</a>
</h2>

<div class="doc_text">
<p>
The new LLVM <a href="http://compiler-rt.llvm.org/">compiler-rt project</a>
is a simple library that provides an implementation of the low-level
target-specific hooks required by code generation and other runtime components.
For example, when compiling for a 32-bit target, converting a double to a 64-bit
unsigned integer is compiled into a runtime call to the "__fixunsdfdi"
function. The compiler-rt library provides highly optimized implementations of
this and other low-level routines (some are 3x faster than the equivalent
libgcc routines).</p>

<p>In the LLVM 2.9 timeframe, compiler_rt has had several minor changes for
  better ARM support, and a fairly major license change.  All of the code in the
  compiler-rt project is now <a href="DeveloperPolicy.html#license">dual
  licensed</a> under MIT and UIUC license, which allows you to use compiler-rt
  in applications without the binary copyright reproduction clause.  If you
  prefer the LLVM/UIUC license, you are free to continue using it under that
  license as well.</p>

<h2>
<a name="lldb">LLDB: Low Level Debugger</a>
</h2>

<div class="doc_text">
<p>
<a href="http://lldb.llvm.org/">LLDB</a> is a brand new member of the LLVM
umbrella of projects. LLDB is a next generation, high-performance debugger. It
is built as a set of reusable components which highly leverage existing
libraries in the larger LLVM Project, such as the Clang expression parser, the
LLVM disassembler and the LLVM JIT.</p>

<p>
LLDB is has advanced by leaps and bounds in the 2.9 timeframe.  It is
dramatically more stable and useful, and includes both a new <a

<a href="http://libcxx.llvm.org/">libc++</a> is another new member of the LLVM
family.  It is an implementation of the C++ standard library, written from the
ground up to specifically target the forthcoming C++'0X standard and focus on
delivering great performance.</p>

<p>
As of the LLVM 2.9 release, UPDATE!

libc++ is now dual licensed under MIT and UIUC license
  
<!--libc++ is virtually feature complete, but would
benefit from more testing and better integration with Clang++.  It is also
looking forward to the C++ committee finalizing the C++'0x standard.-->

<!-- *********************************************************************** -->

<div class="doc_text">

<p>This release includes a huge number of bug fixes, performance tweaks and
minor improvements.  Some of the major improvements and new features are listed
in this section.
</p>

</div>

<!--=========================================================================-->
<h2>
<a name="majorfeatures">Major New Features</a>
</h2>

<div class="doc_text">

<p>LLVM 2.9 includes several major new capabilities:</p>

<ul>
  
<li>
  TBAA: On by default in clang.  Disable it with -fno-strict-aliasing.
  Could be more aggressive for structs.
</li>

<li>New Nvidia PTX backend, not generally useful in 2.9 though.</li>
  
<li>
Much better debug info generated, particularly in optimized code situations.
</li>

<li>
inline asm multiple alternative constraint support.
</li>  
  
<li>
  New naming rules in coding standards: CodingStandards.html#ll_naming
</li>

</ul>
  
</div>

<!--=========================================================================-->
<h2>
<a name="coreimprovements">LLVM IR and Core Improvements</a>
</h2>

<div class="doc_text">
<p>LLVM IR has several new features for better support of new targets and that
expose new optimization opportunities:</p>

<ul>
<li>udiv, ashr, lshr, shl now have exact and nuw/nsw bits:
  PR8862 / LangRef.html</li>
  
  unnamed_addr + PR8927

  new 'hotpatch' attribute: LangRef.html#fnattrs

</ul>

</div>

<!--=========================================================================-->
<h2>
<a name="optimizer">Optimizer Improvements</a>
</h2>

<div class="doc_text">

<p>In addition to a large array of minor performance tweaks and bug fixes, this
release includes a few major enhancements and additions to the optimizers:</p>

<ul>
  <li>LTO has been improved to use MC for parsing inline asm and now
  can build large programs like Firefox 4 on both OS X and Linux.</li>
  
  
 LoopIdiom: memset/memcpy formation and memset_pattern on darwin.  Build with
  -ffreestanding or -fno-builtin if your memcpy is being compiled into infinite
  recursion.
  
  TargetLibraryInfo
    
  EarlyCSE pass.
  LoopInstSimplify pass.
    
New <a href="WritingAnLLVMPass.html#RegionPass">RegionPass</a> infrastructure
  for region-based optimizations.
  
  Can optimize printf to iprintf when no floating point is used, for embedded
  targets with smaller iprintf implementation.

Speedups to various mid-level passes:
  GVN is much faster on functions with deep dominator trees / lots of BBs.
  DomTree and DominatorFrontier are much faster to compute, and preserved by
    more passes (so they are computed less often)
  SRoA is also much faster and doesn't use DominanceFrontier.
  
DSE is more aggressive with stores of different types: e.g. a large store 
  following a small one to the same address.
  
  
We now optimize various idioms for overflow detection into check of the flag
  register on various CPUs, e.g.:
   unsigned long t = a+b;
   if (t &lt; a) ...
  into:
  	addq	%rdi, %rbx
  	jno	LBB0_2

  
</ul>

<!--
<p>In addition to these features that are done in 2.8, there is preliminary
   support in the release for Type Based Alias Analysis 
  Preliminary work on TBAA but not usable in 2.8.
  New CorrelatedValuePropagation pass, not on by default in 2.8 yet.
-->

</div>

<!--=========================================================================-->
<h2>
<a name="mc">MC Level Improvements</a>
</h2>

<div class="doc_text">
<p>
The LLVM Machine Code (aka MC) subsystem was created to solve a number
of problems in the realm of assembly, disassembly, object file format handling,
and a number of other related areas that CPU instruction-set level tools work
in.</p>

<ul>
  <li>MC is now used by default for ELF systems on x86 and
  x86-64.</li>
  <li>MC supports and CodeGen uses the <tt>.loc</tt> directives for
  producing line number debug info. This produces more compact line
  tables.</li>
  <li>MC supports the <tt>.cfi_*</tt> directives for producing DWARF
  frame information, but it is still not used by CodeGen by default.</li>
  <li>COFF support?</li>
  
  
  MC Assembler: X86 now generates much better diagnostics for common errors,
  is much faster at matching instructions, is much more bug-compatible with
  the GAS assembler, and is now generally useful for a broad range of X86
  assembly.
  
  
  ELF MC support: on by default in clang.  There are still known missing features
  for human written assembly.
  
  
  Some basic <a href="CodeGenerator.html#mc">internals documentation</a> for MC. 
  
  MC Assembler support for .file and .loc.
  
  tblgen support for assembler aliases: <a 
    href="CodeGenerator.html#na_instparsing">MnemonicAlias and InstAlias</a>
  
  Win32 PE-COFF support in the MC assembler has made a lot of progress in the 2.9
  timeframe, but is still not generally useful.  Please see 
  "http://llvm.org/bugs/showdependencytree.cgi?id=9100&amp;hide_resolved=1" for open bugs?
  
  
  lib/Object and llvm-objdump
  Experimental format independent object file manipulation library.
  * Supports PE/COFF and ELF.
  * llvm-nm extended to work with object files. Exactly matches
  binutils-nm for the files I've tested.
  * llvm-objdump added with support for disassembly (no relocations displayed).
  


</ul>

<!--=========================================================================-->
<h2>
<a name="codegen">Target Independent Code Generator Improvements</a>
</h2>

<div class="doc_text">

<p>We have put a significant amount of work into the code generator
infrastructure, which allows us to implement more aggressive algorithms and make
it run faster:</p>

<ul>
<!-- SplitKit -->
  
<li>The pre-register-allocation (preRA) instruction scheduler models register
  pressure much more accurately in some cases. This allows the adoption of more
    aggressive scheduling heuristics.
</li>
  
  LiveDebugVariables is a new pass that keeps track of debugging information for
  user variables that are kept in registers in optimized builds.
  

Scheduler now models operand latency and pipeline forwarding.
  
Major regalloc rewrite, not on by default for 2.9 and not advised to use it.
 * New basic register allocator that can be used as a safe fallback when
   debugging. Enable with -regalloc=basic.
 * New infrastructure for live range splitting. SplitKit can break a live
   interval into smaller pieces while preserving SSA form, and SpillPlacement
   can help find the best split points. This is a work in progress so the API
   is changing quickly.
 * The inline spiller has learned to clean up after live range splitting. It
   can hoist spills out of loops, and it can eliminate redundant spills.
   Rematerialization works with live range splitting.
 * New greedy register allocator using live range splitting. This will be the
   default register allocator in the next LLVM release, but it is not turned on
   by default in 2.9.

<h2>
<a name="x86">X86-32 and X86-64 Target Improvements</a>
</h2>

<div class="doc_text">
<p>New features and major changes in the X86 target include:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
X86: Reimplemented all of MMX to introduce a new LLVM IR x86_mmx type.  Now
  random types like &lt;2 x i32&gt; are not iseld to mmx without emms.  The
  -disable-mmx flag is gone now.
</li>
  
  <li>
X86 support for FS/GS relative loads and stores using address space 256/257 are
  reliable now.
  </li>
  
    <li>
X86: Much better codegen for several cases using adc/sbb instead of cmovs for
  conditional increment and other idioms.
    </li>

  <li>
  The X86 backend has adopted a new preRA scheduling
  mode, "list-ilp", to shorten the height of instruction schedules
  without inducing register spills.
  </li>

  MC assembler support for 3dNow! and 3DNowA instructions.
  
  <li>Several bugs have been fixed for Windows x64 code generator.</li>
</ul>

<li>ARM Fast ISel</li>
<li>ARM: New code placement pass.</li>
<li>ARM: Improved code generation for Cortex-A8 and Cortex-A9 CPUs.</li>
<li>ARM: __builtin_prefetch turns into prefetch instructions.</li>
<li>Countless ARM microoptimizations.</li>

<h2>
<a name="changes">Major Changes and Removed Features</a>
</h2>

<div class="doc_text">

<p>If you're already an LLVM user or developer with out-of-tree changes based
on LLVM 2.8, this section lists some "gotchas" that you may run into upgrading
from the previous release.</p>

<ul>
  last release for llvm-gcc

- DIBuilder provides simpler interface for front ends like Clang to encode debug info in LLVM IR.
  - This interface hides implementation details (e.g. DIDerivedType, existence of compile unit etc..) that any front end should not know about.
  For example, DIFactory DebugFactory;
  Ty = DebugFactory.CreateDerivedType(DW_TAG_volatile_type,
  findRegion(TYPE_CONTEXT(type)),
  StringRef(),
  getOrCreateFile(main_input_filename),
  0 /*line no*/,
  NodeSizeInBits(type),
  NodeAlignInBits(type),
  0 /*offset */,
  0 /* flags */,
  MainTy);
  can be replaced by
  DbgTy = DBuilder.createQualifiedType(DW_TAG_volatile_type, MainTy); 
DIFactory is gone now.
  
    



  
  LoopIndexSplit pass was removed, unmaintained.
  LiveValues, SimplifyHalfPowrLibCalls, and GEPSplitter were removed.
  Removed the PartialSpecialization pass, it was unmaintained and buggy.
  
  DIFactory removed, use DIBuilder instead.
  
  Triple::normalize is new, llvm triples are always stored in normalized form internally.
  
  Triple x86_64--mingw64 is obsoleted. Use x86_64--mingw32 instead.

  PointerTracking has been removed from mainline, moved to ClamAV.

</ul>

</div>

<!--=========================================================================-->
<h2>
<a name="api_changes">Internal API Changes</a>
</h2>

<div class="doc_text">

<p>In addition, many APIs have changed in this release.  Some of the major
  LLVM API changes are:</p>

<ul>
  
  include/llvm/System merged into include/llvm/Support.
  
  
  APInt API changes, see PR5207.
  
  MVT::Flag renamed to MVT::Glue
  
  
  error_code + libsystem + PathV2 changes
  The system_error header from C++0x was added.
  * Use if (error_code ec = function()) to check for error conditions
  from functions which return it.
  * error_code::message returns a human readable description of the error.
  
  PathV1 has been deprecated in favor of PathV2 (sorry I didn't finish
  this before the release).
  * No Path class, use a r-value convertible to a twine instead.
  * Assumes all paths are UTF-8.

<div class="doc_text">

<p>The C backend has numerous problems and is not being actively maintained.
Depending on it for anything serious is not advised.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://llvm.org/PR802">The C backend has only basic support for
    inline assembly code</a>.</li>
<li><a href="http://llvm.org/PR1658">The C backend violates the ABI of common
    C++ programs</a>, preventing intermixing between C++ compiled by the CBE and
    C++ code compiled with <tt>llc</tt> or native compilers.</li>
<li>The C backend does not support all exception handling constructs.</li>
<li>The C backend does not support arbitrary precision integers.</li>

  <a name="llvm-gcc">Known problems with the llvm-gcc front-end</a>
</h2>

<div class="doc_text">

<p>llvm-gcc is generally very stable for the C family of languages.  The only
   major language feature of GCC not supported by llvm-gcc is the
   <tt>__builtin_apply</tt> family of builtins.   However, some extensions
   are only supported on some targets.  For example, trampolines are only
   supported on some targets (these are used when you take the address of a
   nested function).</p>

<p>Fortran support generally works, but there are still several unresolved bugs
   in <a href="http://llvm.org/bugs/">Bugzilla</a>.  Please see the
   tools/gfortran component for details.  Note that llvm-gcc is missing major
   Fortran performance work in the frontend and library that went into GCC after
   4.2.  If you are interested in Fortran, we recommend that you consider using
   <a href="#dragonegg">dragonegg</a> instead.</p>

<p>The llvm-gcc 4.2 Ada compiler has basic functionality, but is no longer being
actively maintained.  If you are interested in Ada, we recommend that you
consider using <a href="#dragonegg">dragonegg</a> instead.</p>
