<div class="doc_text">
<p>
The LLVM 2.5 distribution currently consists of code from the core LLVM
repository (which roughly includes the LLVM optimizers, code generators and
supporting tools) and the llvm-gcc repository.  In addition to this code, the
LLVM Project includes other sub-projects that are in development.  The two which
are the most actively developed are the <a href="#clang">Clang Project</a> and
the <a href="#vmkit">VMKit Project</a>.
</p>

</div>


<!--=========================================================================-->
<div class="doc_subsection">
<a name="clang">Clang: C/C++/Objective-C Frontend Toolkit</a>
</div>

<div class="doc_text">

<p>The <a href="http://clang.llvm.org/">Clang project</a> is an effort to build
a set of new 'LLVM native' front-end technologies for the LLVM optimizer
and code generator.  Clang is continuing to make major strides forward in all
areas.  Its C and Objective-C parsing support is very solid, and the code
generation support is far enough along to build many C applications.  While not
yet production quality, it is progressing very nicely.  In addition, C++
front-end work has started to make significant progress.</p>

<p>Clang, in conjunction with the <tt>ccc</tt> driver, is now usable as a
replacement for gcc for building some small- to medium-sized C applications.
Additionally, Clang now has code generation support for Objective-C on Mac OS X
platform. Major highlights include:</p>

<ul>
	<li> Clang/ccc pass almost all of the LLVM test suite on Mac OS X and Linux 
on the 32-bit x86 architecture. This includes significant C 
applications such as <a href="http://www.sqlite.org">sqlite3</a>, 
<a href="http://www.lua.org">lua</a>, and 
<a href="http://www.clamav.net">Clam AntiVirus</a>. </li>

	<li> Clang can build the majority of Objective-C examples shipped with the 
Mac OS X Developer Tools. </li>
</ul>

<p>Clang code generation still needs considerable testing and development,
however.  Some areas under active development include:</p>

<ul>
	<li> Improved support for C and Objective-C features, for example
	variable-length arrays, va_arg, exception handling (Obj-C), and garbage
	collection (Obj-C). </li>
	<li> ABI compatibility, especially for platforms other than 32-bit
	x86. </li>
</ul>

</div>

<!--=========================================================================-->
<div class="doc_subsection">
<a name="clangsa">Clang Static Analyzer</a>
</div>

<div class="doc_text">

<p>The Clang project also includes an early stage static source code analysis
tool for <a href="http://clang.llvm.org/StaticAnalysis.html">automatically
finding bugs</a> in C and Objective-C programs. The tool performs a growing set
of checks to find bugs that occur on a specific path within a program.  Examples
of bugs the tool finds include logic errors such as null dereferences,
violations of various API rules, dead code, and potential memory leaks in
Objective-C programs. Since its inception, public feedback on the tool has been
extremely positive, and conservative estimates put the number of real bugs it
has found in industrial-quality software on the order of thousands.</p>

<p>The tool also provides a simple web GUI to inspect potential bugs found by
the tool.  While still early in development, the GUI illustrates some of the key
features of Clang: accurate source location information, which is used by the
GUI to highlight specific code expressions that relate to a bug (including those
that span multiple lines); and built-in knowledge of macros, which is used to
perform inline expansion of macros within the GUI itself.</p>

<p>The set of checks performed by the static analyzer is gradually expanding,
and future plans for the tool include full source-level inter-procedural
analysis and deeper checks such as buffer overrun detection. There are many
opportunities to extend and enhance the static analyzer, and anyone interested
in working on this project is encouraged to get involved!</p>

a JVM and a CLI Virtual Machines (Microsoft .NET is an
implementation of the CLI) using the Just-In-Time compiler of LLVM.</p>

<p>Following LLVM 2.5, VMKit has its first release 0.24 that you can find on its

  <a name="portability">Portability and Supported Platforms</a>
</div>
<!-- *********************************************************************** -->

<div class="doc_text">

<p>LLVM is known to work on the following platforms:</p>

<ul>
<li>Intel and AMD machines (IA32, X86-64, AMD64, EMT-64) running Red Hat 
Linux, Fedora Core and FreeBSD (and probably other unix-like systems).</li>
<li>PowerPC and X86-based Mac OS X systems, running 10.3 and above in 32-bit 
and 64-bit modes.</li>
<li>Intel and AMD machines running on Win32 using MinGW libraries (native).</li>
<li>Intel and AMD machines running on Win32 with the Cygwin libraries (limited
    support is available for native builds with Visual C++).</li>
<li>Sun UltraSPARC workstations running Solaris 10.</li>
<li>Alpha-based machines running Debian GNU/Linux.</li>
<li>Itanium-based (IA64) machines running Linux and HP-UX.</li>
</ul>

<p>The core LLVM infrastructure uses GNU autoconf to adapt itself
to the machine and operating system on which it is built.  However, minor
porting may be required to get LLVM to work on new platforms.  We welcome your
portability patches and reports of successful builds or error messages.</p>

<p>The following components of this LLVM release are either untested, known to
be broken or unreliable, or are in early development.  These components should
not be relied on, and bugs should not be filed against them, but they may be
useful to some people.  In particular, if you would like to work on one of these
components, please contact us on the <a

    all <a href="http://llvm.org/PR879">inline assembly that uses the X86
    floating point stack</a>.  It supports the 'f' and 't' constraints, but not
    'u'.</li>
  <li>The X86 backend generates inefficient floating point code when configured
    to generate code for systems that don't have SSE2.</li>
  <li>Win64 code generation wasn't widely tested. Everything should work, but we
    expect small issues to happen. Also, llvm-gcc cannot build mingw64 runtime
    currently due
    to <a href="http://llvm.org/PR2255">several</a>
    <a href="http://llvm.org/PR2257">bugs</a> due to lack of support for the
    'u' inline assembly constraint and X87 floating point inline assembly.</li>

  <a name="ada-fe">Known problems with the llvm-gcc Ada front-end</a>
</div>

<div class="doc_text">
The llvm-gcc 4.2 Ada compiler works fairly well, however this is not a mature
technology and problems should be expected.
<ul>
<li>The Ada front-end currently only builds on X86-32.  This is mainly due
to lack of trampoline support (pointers to nested functions) on other platforms,
however it <a href="http://llvm.org/PR2006">also fails to build on X86-64</a>
which does support trampolines.</li>
<li>The Ada front-end <a href="http://llvm.org/PR2007">fails to bootstrap</a>.
Workaround: configure with --disable-bootstrap.</li>
<li>The c380004, <a href="http://llvm.org/PR2010">c393010</a>
and <a href="http://llvm.org/PR2421">cxg2021</a> ACATS tests fail
(c380004 also fails with gcc-4.2 mainline).</li>
<li>Some gcc specific Ada tests continue to crash the compiler.</li>
<li>The -E binder option (exception backtraces)
<a href="http://llvm.org/PR1982">does not work</a> and will result in programs
crashing if an exception is raised.  Workaround: do not use -E.</li>
<li>Only discrete types <a href="http://llvm.org/PR1981">are allowed to start
or finish at a non-byte offset</a> in a record.  Workaround: do not pack records
or use representation clauses that result in a field of a non-discrete type
starting or finishing in the middle of a byte.</li>
<li>The <tt>lli</tt> interpreter <a href="http://llvm.org/PR2009">considers
'main' as generated by the Ada binder to be invalid</a>.
Workaround: hand edit the file to use pointers for <tt>argv</tt> and
<tt>envp</tt> rather than integers.</li>
<li>The <tt>-fstack-check</tt> option <a href="http://llvm.org/PR2008">is
ignored</a>.</li>
