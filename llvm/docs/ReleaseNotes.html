<div class="doc_text">

<p>This is the eighth public release of the LLVM Compiler Infrastructure. This
release incorporates a large number of enhancements and new features,
including vector support (Intel SSE and Altivec), a new GCC4.0-based
C/C++ front-end, Objective C/C++ support, inline assembly support, and many
other big features.
</p>

<a name="newfeatures">New Features in LLVM 1.7</a>
</div>

<!--_________________________________________________________________________-->
<div class="doc_subsubsection"><a name="llvmgcc4">GCC4.0-based llvm-gcc
front-end</a></div>

<div class="doc_text">

<p>LLVM 1.7 includes a brand new llvm-gcc, based on GCC 4.0.1.  This version
of llvm-gcc solves many serious long-standing problems with llvm-gcc, including
all of those blocked by the <a href="http://llvm.org/PR498">llvm-gcc 4 meta 
bug</a>.  In addition, llvm-gcc4 implements support for many new features, 
including GCC inline assembly, generic vector support, SSE and Altivec
intrinsics, and several new GCC attributes.  In addition, llvm-gcc4 is 
significantly faster than llvm-gcc3, respects -O options, its -c/-S options
correspond to GCC's (they emit native code), and it has debugging support well
underway.</p>

<p>If you can use it, llvm-gcc4 is offers significant new functionality, and we
hope that it will replace llvm-gcc3 completely in a future release.  
Unfortunately, it does not currently support C++ exception handling at all, and
it only works on Apple Mac OS/X machines with X86 or PowerPC processors.
</p>

</div>

<!--_________________________________________________________________________-->
<div class="doc_subsubsection"><a name="inlineasm">Inline Assembly
Support</a></div>

<div class="doc_text">

<p>The LLVM IR and llvm-gcc4 front-end now fully support arbitrary GCC <a 
href="LangRef.html#inlineasm">inline assembly</a>.  The LLVM X86 and PowerPC
code generators have initial support for it,
being able to compile basic statements, but are missing some features.  Please
report any inline asm statements that crash the compiler or that are miscompiled
as bugs.</p>

</div>

<!--_________________________________________________________________________-->
<div class="doc_subsubsection"><a name="newsparc">New SPARC backend</a></div>

<div class="doc_text">

<p>LLVM 1.7 includes a new, fully functional, SPARC backend built in the
target-independent code generator.  This SPARC backend includes support for 
SPARC V8 and SPARC V9 subtargets (controlling whether V9 features can be used),
and targets the 32-bit SPARC ABI.</p>

<p>The LLVM 1.7 release is the last release that will include the LLVM "SparcV9"
backend, which was the very first LLVM native code generator.  In 1.8, it will
be removed, replaced with the new SPARC backend.</p>

</div>

<!--_________________________________________________________________________-->
<div class="doc_subsubsection"><a name="genvector">Generic Vector Support
</a></div>

<div class="doc_text">

<p>LLVM now includes significantly extended support for SIMD vectors in its
core instruction set.  It now includes three new instructions for manipulating
vectors: <a href="LangRef.html#i_extractelement"><tt>extractelement</tt></a>,
<a href="LangRef.html#i_insertelement"><tt>insertelement</tt></a>, and
<a href="LangRef.html#i_shufflevector"><tt>shufflevector</tt></a>.  Further,
many bugs in vector handling have been fixed, and vectors are now supported by
the target-independent code generator.  For example, if a vector operation is
not supported by a particular target, it will be correctly broken down and
executed as scalar operations.</p>

<p>Because llvm-gcc3 does not support GCC generic vectors or vector intrinsics,
so llvm-gcc4 must be used.</p>
</div>


<!--_________________________________________________________________________-->
<div class="doc_subsubsection"><a name="ssealtivec">Intel SSE and PowerPC 
Altivec support
</a></div>

<div class="doc_text">

<p>The LLVM X86 backend now supports Intel SSE 1, 2, and 3, and now uses scalar
SSE operations to implement scalar floating point math when the target supports
SSE1 (for floats) or SSE2 (for doubles).  Vector SSE instructions are generated
by llvm-gcc4 when the generic vector mechanism or specific SSE intrinsics are 
used.
</p>

<p>The LLVM PowerPC backend now supports the Altivec instruction set, including
both GCC -maltivec and -faltivec modes.  Altivec instructions are generated
by llvm-gcc4 when the generic vector mechanism or specific Altivec intrinsics
are used.
</p>

</div>

<!--_________________________________________________________________________-->
<div class="doc_subsubsection"><a name="optimizernew">Optimizer 
Improvements</a></div>

<div class="doc_text">
<ul>
<li>The Loop Unswitching pass (<tt>-loop-unswitch</tt>) has had several bugs
    fixed, has several new features, and is enabled by default in llvmgcc3
    now.</li>
<li>The Loop Strength Reduction pass (<tt>-loop-reduce</tt>) is now enabled for
    the X86 backend.</li>
<li>The Instruction Combining pass (<tt>-instcombine</tt>) now includes a
    framework and implementation for simplifying code based on whether computed
    bits are demanded or not.</li>
<li>The Scalar Replacement of Aggregates pass (<tt>-scalarrepl</tt>) can now
    promote simple unions to registers.</li>
<li>The Reassociation pass (<tt>-reassociate</tt>) can now
    factor expressions, e.g. turning "A*A+A*B" into "A*(A+B)".</li>
<li>Several LLVM passes are <a href="http://llvm.org/PR681">significantly
faster</a>.</li>
</ul>
</div>

<!--_________________________________________________________________________-->
<div class="doc_subsubsection"><a name="codgennew">Code Generator 
Improvements</a></div>

<div class="doc_text">
<ul>
<li>LLVM has a new prepass (before register allocation) list scheduler, which
    supports bottom-up and top-down scheduling, pluggable priority functions and
    pluggable hazard recognizers.  The X86 backend uses this to reduce register
    pressure and RISC targets schedule based on operation latency.</li>
<li>The tblgen-based target description framework introduced in LLVM 1.6 has
    several new features, useful for targets that can fold loads and stores into
    operations, and features that make the .td files more expressive.</li>
<li>The instruction selector is significantly faster in 1.7 than in 1.6.</li>
<li>The X86, Alpha and Itanium backends use new DAG-DAG instruction selectors,
    making them easier to maintain and generate slightly better code.</li>
<li>The X86 backend now supports generation of Scalar SSE code for scalar FP
    expressions.  LLVM provides significantly better performance with Scalar SSE
    instructions than it does with the Intel floating point stack 
    instructions.</li>
<li>The Itanium backend now has a bundling pass, which improves performance
    by ~10% and reduces code size (previously it unconditionally inserted a stop
    bit after every instruction).</li>
</ul>
</div>

<!--_________________________________________________________________________-->
<div class="doc_subsubsection"><a name="othernew">Other New Features</a></div>

<div class="doc_text">
<ul>
<li>The Mac OS/X PowerPC and X86 backends now have initial support Darwin DWARF
    debugging information, however, debug info generation has been disabled for
    the 1.7 release in llvmgcc4.</li>
<li>LLVM includes the new <a href="docs/CommandGuide/html/llvm-config.html">
    llvm-config</a> utility, which makes it easier to build and link programs
    against the LLVM libraries when not using the LLVM makefiles.</li>
<li>LLVM now supports first class global ctor/dtor initialization lists, no
    longer forcing targets to use "__main".</li>
<li>LLVM supports assigning globals and functions to a particular section
    in the result executable using the GCC section attribute.</li>
<li><a href="ExtendingLLVM.html">Adding intrinsics to LLVM</a> is now
     significantly easier.</li>
<li>llvmgcc4 now fully supports C99 Variable Length Arrays, including dynamic
    stack deallocation.</li>

</ul>
</div>


<!--=========================================================================-->
<div class="doc_subsection">
<a name="changes">Significant Changes in LLVM 1.7</a>
</div>

<div class="doc_text">
<ul>
<li>The official LLVM URL is now <a href="http://llvm.org/">
    http://llvm.org/</a>.</li>
<li>The LLVM intrinsics used to be overloaded based on type: for example,
    <a href="LangRef.html#int_ctpop"><tt>llvm.ctpop</tt></a> could work with any
    integer datatype.  They are now separated into different intrinsics with
    suffixes to denote their argument type (e.g. <tt>llvm.ctpop.i32</tt>)).  Old
    LLVM .ll and .bc files that use these intrinsics will continue to work with
    new LLVM versions (they are transparently upgraded by the parsers), but will
    cause a warning to be emitted.</li>
<li>The <tt>llvm.readport</tt>, <tt>llvm.writeport</tt>, <tt>llvm.readio</tt>,
    and <tt>llvm.writeio</tt> intrinsics have been removed.  The first two
    were ever only supported by the X86 backend, the last two were never
    correctly supported by any target, and none were accessible through the
    C front-end.  Inline assembly support can now be used to
    implement these operations.</li>
<li>The <tt>llvm-db</tt> tool had basic support for stepping through code, which
    used the JIT.  This code has been removed, and DWARF emission support added
    instead.  <tt>llvm-db</tt> still exists in CVS if someone wanted to write a
    <tt>ptrace</tt> backend for it.</li>
</ul>
</div>

<div class="doc_section">
  <a name="portability">Portability and Supported Platforms</a>
</div>
<!-- *********************************************************************** -->

<div class="doc_text">

<p>LLVM is known to work on the following platforms:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Intel and AMD machines running Red Hat Linux, Fedora Core and FreeBSD 
      (and probably other unix-like systems).</li>
<li>Sun UltraSPARC workstations running Solaris 8.</li>
<li>Intel and AMD machines running on Win32 with the Cygwin libraries (limited
    support is available for native builds with Visual C++).</li>
<li>PowerPC and X86-based Mac OS X systems, running 10.2 and above.</li>
<li>Alpha-based machines running Debian GNU/Linux.</li>
<li>Itanium-based machines running Linux and HP-UX.</li>
</ul>

<p>The core LLVM infrastructure uses
<a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/autoconf/">GNU autoconf</a> to adapt itself
to the machine and operating system on which it is built.  However, minor
porting may be required to get LLVM to work on new platforms.  We welcome your
portability patches and reports of successful builds or error messages.</p>

<div class="doc_subsubsection">Bugs</div>

<div class="doc_text">

<p>
llvm-gcc3 has many significant problems that are fixed by llvm-gcc4.  See
    those blocked on the <a href="http://llvm.org/PR498">llvm-gcc4 meta bug</a>.
Two major ones include:</p>

<ul>
<li>With llvm-gcc3, 
    C99 variable sized arrays do not release stack memory when they go out of 
    scope.  Thus, the following program may run out of stack space:
<pre>
    for (i = 0; i != 1000000; ++i) {
      int X[n];
      foo(X);
    }
</pre></li>

<li>With llvm-gcc3, Initialization of global union variables can only be done <a
href="http://llvm.org/PR162">with the largest union member</a>.</li>

</ul>
</div>

<!-- _______________________________________________________________________ -->
<div class="doc_subsubsection">
  Notes
</div>

<div class="doc_text">

<ul>

<li>"long double" is transformed by the front-end into "double".  There is no
support for floating point data types of any size other than 32 and 64
bits.</li>
    
<li>The following Unix system functionality has not been tested and may not
work:
  <ol>
  <li><tt>sigsetjmp</tt>, <tt>siglongjmp</tt> - These are not turned into the
      appropriate <tt>invoke</tt>/<tt>unwind</tt> instructions.  Note that
      <tt>setjmp</tt> and <tt>longjmp</tt> <em>are</em> compiled correctly.
  <li><tt>getcontext</tt>, <tt>setcontext</tt>, <tt>makecontext</tt>
      - These functions have not been tested.
  </ol></li>

<li>Although many GCC extensions are supported, some are not.  In particular,
    the following extensions are known to <b>not be</b> supported:

</div>

<div class="doc_text">

<p>For this release, the C++ front-end is considered to be fully
tested and works for a number of non-trivial programs, including LLVM
itself.</p>

<div class="doc_subsubsection">Bugs</div>

  Notes
</div>

<div class="doc_text">

<ul>

<li>Destructors for local objects are not always run when a <tt>longjmp</tt> is
    performed. In particular, destructors for objects in the <tt>longjmp</tt>ing
    function and in the <tt>setjmp</tt> receiver function may not be run.
    Objects in intervening stack frames will be destroyed, however (which is
    better than most compilers).</li>

<li>The LLVM C++ front-end follows the <a
    href="http://www.codesourcery.com/cxx-abi">Itanium C++ ABI</a>.
    This document, which is not Itanium specific, specifies a standard for name
    mangling, class layout, v-table layout, RTTI formats, and other C++
    representation issues.  Because we use this API, code generated by the LLVM
    compilers should be binary compatible with machine code generated by other
    Itanium ABI C++ compilers (such as G++, the Intel and HP compilers, etc).
    <i>However</i>, the exception handling mechanism used by LLVM is very
    different from the model used in the Itanium ABI, so <b>exceptions will not
    interact correctly</b>. </li>

<div class="doc_subsection">
  <a name="c-be">Known problems with the C back-end</a>
</div>

<div class="doc_text">

<ul>

<li>The C back-end produces code that violates the ANSI C Type-Based Alias
Analysis rules.  As such, special options may be necessary to compile the code
(for example, GCC requires the <tt>-fno-strict-aliasing</tt> option).  This
problem probably cannot be fixed.</li>

<li><a href="http://llvm.org/PR56">Zero arg vararg functions are not 
supported</a>.  This should not affect LLVM produced by the C or C++ 
frontends.</li>

<li>The C backend does not correctly implement the <a 
href="LangRef.html#i_stacksave"><tt>llvm.stacksave</tt></a> or
<a href="LangRef.html#i_stackrestore"><tt>llvm.stackrestore</tt></a> 
intrinsics.  This means that some code compiled by it can run out of stack
space if they depend on these (e.g. C99 varargs).</li>

  <a name="ia64-be">Known problems with the IA64 back-end</a>
</div>

<div class="doc_text">

<ul>

<li>C++ programs are likely to fail on IA64, as calls to <tt>setjmp</tt> are
made where the argument is not 16-byte aligned, as required on IA64. (Strictly
speaking this is not a bug in the IA64 back-end; it will also be encountered
when building C++ programs using the C back-end.)</li>

<li>The C++ front-end does not use <a href="http://llvm.org/PR406">IA64
ABI compliant layout of v-tables</a>.  In particular, it just stores function
pointers instead of function descriptors in the vtable.  This bug prevents
mixing C++ code compiled with LLVM with C++ objects compiled by other C++
compilers.</li>

<li>There are a few ABI violations which will lead to problems when mixing LLVM
output with code built with other compilers, particularly for floating-point
programs.</li>
