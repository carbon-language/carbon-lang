<p>
The LLVM 2.5 distribution currently consists of code from the core LLVM
repository (which roughly includes the LLVM optimizers, code generators and
supporting tools) and the llvm-gcc repository.  In addition to this code, the
LLVM Project includes other sub-projects that are in development.  The two which
are the most actively developed are the <a href="#clang">Clang Project</a> and
the <a href="#vmkit">VMKit Project</a>.
</p>

</div>


<!--=========================================================================-->
<div class="doc_subsection">
<a name="clang">Clang: C/C++/Objective-C Frontend Toolkit</a>
</div>

<div class="doc_text">

<p>The <a href="http://clang.llvm.org/">Clang project</a> is an effort to build
a set of new 'LLVM native' front-end technologies for the LLVM optimizer
and code generator.  While Clang is not included in the LLVM 2.5 release, it 
is continuing to make major strides forward in all areas.  Its C and Objective-C
parsing and code generation support is now very solid.  For example, it is
capable of successfully building many real applications for X86-32 and X86-64,
including <a href="http://wiki.freebsd.org/BuildingFreeBSDWithClang">the FreeBSD
kernel</a>.  C++ is also making <a
href="http://clang.llvm.org/cxx_status.html">incredible progress</a>, and work
on templates has recently started.</p>

<p>While Clang is not yet production quality, it is progressing very nicely and
is quite usable for building many C and Objective-C applications.  If you are
interested in fast compiles and good diagnostics, we encourage you to try it out
by <a href="http://clang.llvm.org/get_started.html">building from mainline</a>
and reporting any issues you hit to the <a 
href="http://lists.cs.uiuc.edu/mailman/listinfo/cfe-dev">Clang front-end mailing
list</a>.</p>

<p>In the LLVM 2.5 time-frame, the Clang team has made many improvements:</p>

<ul>
<li>Clang now has a new driver, which is focused on providing a GCC-compatible
    interface.</li> 
<li>The X86-64 ABI is now supported.</li> 
<li>Precompiled header support is now implemented.</li> 
<li>Objective-C support is significantly improved beyond LLVM 2.4, supporting
    many features, such as Objective-C Garbage Collection.</li>
<li>Many many bugs are fixed.</li>
</div>

<!--=========================================================================-->
<div class="doc_subsection">
<a name="clangsa">Clang Static Analyzer</a>
</div>

<div class="doc_text">

<p>Previously announced in the last LLVM release, the Clang project also
includes an early stage static source code analysis tool for <a
href="http://clang.llvm.org/StaticAnalysis.html">automatically finding bugs</a>
in C and Objective-C programs. The tool performs a growing set of checks to find
bugs that occur on a specific path within a program.</p>

<p>In the LLVM 2.5 time-frame there have been many significant improvements to
the analyzer's core path simulation engine and machinery for generating
path-based bug reports to end-users. Particularly noteworthy improvements
include experimental support for full field-sensitivity and reasoning about heap
objects as well as an improved value-constraints subengine that does a much
better job of reasoning about inequality relationships (e.g., <tt>x &gt; 2</tt>)
between variables and constants.

<p>The set of checks performed by the static analyzer continue to expand, and
future plans for the tool include full source-level inter-procedural analysis
and deeper checks such as buffer overrun detection. There are many opportunities
to extend and enhance the static analyzer, and anyone interested in working on
this project is encouraged to get involved!</p>

<a name="vmkit">VMKit: JVM/CLI Virtual Machine Implementation</a>
</div>

<div class="doc_text">
<p>
The <a href="http://vmkit.llvm.org/">VMKit project</a> is an implementation of
a JVM and a CLI Virtual Machines (Microsoft .NET is an
implementation of the CLI) using the Just-In-Time compiler of LLVM.</p>

<p>Following LLVM 2.5, VMKit has its first release ? that you can find on its
<a href="http://vmkit.llvm.org/releases/">webpage</a>. The release includes
bug fixes, cleanup and new features. The major changes are:</p>

<ul>

<li>Ahead of Time compiler: compiles .class files to llvm .bc. VMKit uses this
functionality to native compile the standard classes (eg java.lang.String).
Users can compile AOT .class files into dynamic libraries and run them with the
help of VMKit.</li>

<li>New exception model: the dwarf exception model is very slow for
exception-intensive applications, so the JVM has had a new implementation of
exceptions which check at each function call if an exception happened. There is
a low performance penalty on applications without exceptions, but it is a big
gain for exception-intensive applications. For example the jack benchmark in
Spec JVM98 is 6x faster (performance gain of 83%).</li>

<li>New support for OSX/X64, Linux/X64 (with the Boehm GC), Linux/ppc32.</li>

</ul>

<a name="pure">Pure</a>
</div>

<div class="doc_text">
<p>
http://pure-lang.googlecode.com/
</p>

<p>
Pure is an algebraic/functional programming language based on term rewriting.
Programs are collections of equations which are used to evaluate expressions in
a symbolic fashion. Pure offers dynamic typing, eager and lazy evaluation,
lexical closures, a hygienic macro system (also based on term rewriting), 
built-in list and matrix support (including list and matrix comprehensions) and
an easy-to-use C interface. The interpreter uses LLVM as a backend to
 JIT-compile Pure programs to fast native code.</p>

<p>In addition to the usual algebraic data structures, Pure also has
MATLAB-style matrices in order to support numeric computations and signal
processing in an efficient way. Pure is mainly aimed at mathematical
applications right now, but it has been designed as a general purpose language.
The dynamic interpreter environment and the C interface make it possible to use
it as a kind of functional scripting language for many application areas.

</p>

<p>
I'd like to inform that the LDC project (LLVM D
Compiler) is working with release 2.5 of LLVM. In fact we've required
2.5 in our trunk since the release was branched.
The improvements in 2.5 have fixed a lot of problems with LDC, more
specifically the new inline asm constraints, better debug info
support, general bugfixes :) and better x86-64 support have allowed
some major improvements in LDC, getting us much closer to being as
fully featured as the original DMD compiler from DigitalMars.

<p>This release includes a huge number of bug fixes, performance tweaks, and
minor improvements.  Some of the major improvements and new features are listed
in this section.

</div>

<!--=========================================================================-->
<div class="doc_subsection">
<a name="majorfeatures">Major New Features</a>
</div>

<div class="doc_text">

<p>LLVM 2.5 includes several major new capabilities:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>The code generator now supports arbitrary precision integers.
Types like <tt>i33</tt> have long been valid in the LLVM IR, but previously
could only be used with the interpreter.
Now IR using such types can be compiled to native code on all targets.
All operations are supported if the integer is not bigger than twice the
target machine word size.
Simple operations like loads, stores and shifts by a constant amount are
supported for integers of any size.
</p></li>

</div>

<div class="doc_text">
<p>New features include:</p>

<ul>
<li>Beginning with LLVM 2.5, llvmc2 is known as just 'llvmc'. The
 old llvmc driver was removed.</li>

<li>The Clang plugin was substantially improved and is now enabled
 by default. The command 'llvmc --clang' can be now used as a
 synonym to 'ccc'.</li>

<li>There is now a '--check-graph' option which is supposed to
 catch common errors like multiple default edges, mismatched
 output/input language names and cycles. In general, these
 checks can't be done at compile-time because of the need to
 support plugins.</li>

<li>Plugins are now more flexible and can refer to compilation
 graph nodes and options defined in other plugins. To manage
 dependencies, a priority-sorting mechanism was introduced. This
 change affects the '.td' file syntax; see the documentation for
 details.</li>

<li>Hooks can now be provided with arguments. The syntax
 is "$CALL(MyHook, 'Arg1', 'Arg2', 'Arg #3')".</li>

<li>A new option type: multi-valued option, for options that take
 more than one argument (for example, "-foo a b c").</li>

<li>New option properties: 'one_or_more', 'zero_or_more', 'hidden'
 and 'really_hidden'.</li>

<li>The 'case' expression gained an 'error' action and an 'empty'
 test (equivalent to '(not (not_empty ...))').</li>

<li>Documentation now looks more consistent to the rest of the LLVM
 docs. There is also a man page now.</li>

<div class="doc_text">

<p>LLVM is known to work on the following platforms:</p>

<ul>
<li>Intel and AMD machines (IA32, X86-64, AMD64, EMT-64) running Red Hat 
Linux, Fedora Core and FreeBSD (and probably other unix-like systems).</li>
<li>PowerPC and X86-based Mac OS X systems, running 10.3 and above in 32-bit 
and 64-bit modes.</li>
<li>Intel and AMD machines running on Win32 using MinGW libraries (native).</li>
<li>Intel and AMD machines running on Win32 with the Cygwin libraries (limited

    in Bugzilla.  Please see the tools/gfortran component for details.</li>
    
<li>The Fortran front-end currently does not build on Darwin (without tweaks)

  <a name="ada-fe">Known problems with the llvm-gcc Ada front-end</a>
</div>

<div class="doc_text">
The llvm-gcc 4.2 Ada compiler works fairly well, however this is not a mature
technology and problems should be expected.
<ul>
<li>The Ada front-end currently only builds on X86-32.  This is mainly due
to lack of trampoline support (pointers to nested functions) on other platforms,
however it <a href="http://llvm.org/PR2006">also fails to build on X86-64</a>
which does support trampolines.</li>
<li>The Ada front-end <a href="http://llvm.org/PR2007">fails to bootstrap</a>.
This is due to lack of LLVM support for <tt>setjmp</tt>/<tt>longjmp</tt> style
exception handling, which is used internally by the compiler.
Workaround: configure with --disable-bootstrap.</li>
<li>The c380004, <a href="http://llvm.org/PR2010">c393010</a>
and <a href="http://llvm.org/PR2421">cxg2021</a> ACATS tests fail
(c380004 also fails with gcc-4.2 mainline).
If the compiler is built with checks disabled then <a href="http://llvm.org/PR2010">c393010</a>
causes the compiler to go into an infinite loop, using up all system memory.</li>
<li>Some gcc specific Ada tests continue to crash the compiler.</li>
<li>The -E binder option (exception backtraces)
<a href="http://llvm.org/PR1982">does not work</a> and will result in programs
crashing if an exception is raised.  Workaround: do not use -E.</li>
<li>Only discrete types <a href="http://llvm.org/PR1981">are allowed to start
or finish at a non-byte offset</a> in a record.  Workaround: do not pack records
or use representation clauses that result in a field of a non-discrete type
starting or finishing in the middle of a byte.</li>
<li>The <tt>lli</tt> interpreter <a href="http://llvm.org/PR2009">considers
'main' as generated by the Ada binder to be invalid</a>.
Workaround: hand edit the file to use pointers for <tt>argv</tt> and
<tt>envp</tt> rather than integers.</li>
<li>The <tt>-fstack-check</tt> option <a href="http://llvm.org/PR2008">is
ignored</a>.</li>
