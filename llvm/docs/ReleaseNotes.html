<div class="doc_text">

<p>This is the eleventh public release of the LLVM Compiler Infrastructure. 
Being the first major release since 1.0, this release is different in several
ways from our previous releases:</p>

<ol>
<li>We took this as an opportunity to
break backwards compatibility with the LLVM 1.x bytecode and .ll file format.
If you have LLVM 1.9 .ll files that you would like to upgrade to LLVM 2.x, we 
recommend the use of the stand alone <a href="#llvm-upgrade">llvm-upgrade</a>
tool (which is included with 2.0).  We intend to keep compatibility with .ll 
and .bc formats within the 2.x release series, like we did within the 1.x 
series.</li>
<li>There are several significant change to the LLVM IR and internal APIs, such
    as a major overhaul of the type system, the completely new bitcode file
    format, etc.</li>
<li>We designed the release around a 6 month release cycle instead of the usual
    3-month cycle.  This gave us extra time to develop and test some of the
    more invasive features in this release.</li>
<li>LLVM 2.0 no longer supports the llvm-gcc3 front-end.</li>
</ol>

<p>Note that while this is a major version bump, this release has been
   extensively tested on a wide range of software.  It is easy to say that this
   is our best release yet, in terms of both features and correctness.</p>

</div>

<!--_________________________________________________________________________-->
<div class="doc_subsubsection"><a name="majorchanges">Major Changes</a></div>
<div class="doc_text">
<p>blah
</p>

<ul>

<li>llvm-gcc3 is now officially unsupported.  Users are required to
    upgrade to llvm-gcc4.  llvm-gcc4 includes many features over
    llvm-gcc3, is faster, and is much easier to build.</li>

<li>Integer types are now completely signless. This means that we
    have types like i8/i16/i32 instead of ubyte/sbyte/short/ushort/int
    etc. LLVM operations that depend on sign have been split up into 
    separate instructions (<a href="http://llvm.org/PR950">PR950</a>).</li>

<li>Arbitrary bitwidth integers (e.g. i13, i36, i42, etc) are now
    supported in the LLVM IR and optimizations. However, neither llvm-gcc nor
    the native code generators support non-standard width integers 
    (<a href="http://llvm.org/PR1043">PR1043</a>).</li>

<li>'type planes' have been removed (<a href="http://llvm.org/PR411">PR411</a>).
    It is no longer possible to have two values with the same name in the 
    same symbol table.  This simplifies LLVM internals, allowing significant 
    speedups.</li>

<li>Global variables and functions in .ll files are now prefixed with
    @ instead of % (<a href="http://llvm.org/PR645">PR645</a>).</li>

<li>The LLVM 1.x "bytecode" format has been replaced with a  
    completely new binary representation, named 'bitcode'.  Because we  
    plan to maintain binary compatibility between LLVM 2.x ".bc" files,  
    this is an important change to get right.  Bitcode brings a number of  
    advantages to the LLVM over the old bytecode format.  It is denser  
    (files are smaller), more extensible, requires less memory to read,  
    is easier to keep backwards compatible (so LLVM 2.5 will read 2.0 .bc  
    files), and has many other nice features.</li>

<li>Support was added for alignment values on load and store
    instructions (<a href="http://www.llvm.org/PR400">PR400</a>).  This 
    allows the IR to express loads that are not
    sufficiently aligned (e.g. due to pragma packed) or to capture extra
    alignment information. </li>

<li>LLVM now has a new MSIL backend. llc - march=msil will now turn LLVM 
    into MSIL (".net") bytecode.  This is still fairly early development 
    with a number of limitations.</li>

<li>Support has been added for 'protected visibility' in ELF.</li>

<li>Thread Local Storage with the __thread keyword was implemented along 
    with added codegen support for Linux on X86 and ARM.</li>

<li>ELF symbol aliases supported has been added.</li>

<li>Added support for 'polymorphic intrinsics', allowing things like 
    llvm.ctpop to work on arbitrary width integers.</li>

</ul>
  
</div>


<!--_________________________________________________________________________-->
<div class="doc_subsubsection"><a name="llvmgccfeatures">llvm-gcc
Improvements</a></div>
<div class="doc_text">
<p>New features include:
</p>

<ul>
<li>Precompiled Headers (PCH) support has been implemented.</li>

<li>Support for external weak linkage and hidden visibility has been added.</li>

<li>Packed structure types are now supported , which allows LLVM to express 
    unaligned data more naturally.</li>

<li>Inline assembly support has been improved and many bugs were fixed.
    The two large missing features are support for 80-bit floating point stack 
    registers on X86 (<a href="http://llvm.org/PR879">PR879</a>), and support for inline asm in the C backend (<a href="http://llvm.org/PR802">PR802</a>).</li>

<li>Ada support, such as nested functions, has been improved.</li>

<li>Tracking function parameter/result attributes is now possible.</li>

<li>Its is now easier to configure llvm-gcc for linux.</li>

<li>Many enhancements have been added, such as improvements to NON_LVALUE_EXPR,
    arrays with non-zero base, structs with variable sized fields,  
    VIEW_CONVERT_EXPR, CEIL_DIV_EXPR, and many other things.</li>

<li>Improved "attribute packed" support in the CFE, and handle many
    other obscure struct layout cases correctly.</li>

</ul>
  
</div>

<!--_________________________________________________________________________-->
<div class="doc_subsubsection"><a name="optimizer">Optimizer
Improvements</a></div>
<div class="doc_text">
<p>New features include:
</p>

<ul>
<li>The pass manager has been entirely rewritten, making it significantly 
    smaller, simpler, and more extensible. Support has been added to run 
    FunctionPasses interlaced with CallGraphSCCPasses.</li>

<li>The -scalarrepl pass can now promote unions containing FP values into
    a register, it can also handle unions of vectors of the same size.</li>

<li>The predicate simplifier pass has been improved, making it able to do 
    simple value range propagation and eliminate more conditionals.</li>

<li>There is a new new LoopPass class. The passmanager has been
    modified to support it, and all existing loop xforms have been
    converted to use it. </li>

<li>There is a new loop rotation pass, which converts "for loops" into 
    "do/while loops", where the condition is at the bottom of the loop.</li>

<li>ModulePasses may now use the result of FunctionPasses.</li>

<li>The [Post]DominatorSet classes have been removed from LLVM and clients switched to use the far-more-efficient ETForest class instead.  </li>

<li>The ImmediateDominator class has also been removed, and clients have been switched to use DominatorTree instead.</li>

</ul>
  
</div>

<!--_________________________________________________________________________-->
<div class="doc_subsubsection"><a name="codegen">Code
Generator Enhancements</a></div>

<div class="doc_text">
<p>
New features include:
</p>

<ul>
<li>Support for Zero-cost DWARF exception handling has been added. It is mostly
    complete and just in need of continued bug fixes and optimizations at 
    this point.</li>

<li>Progress has been made on a direct Mach-o .o file writer. Many small 
    apps work, but it is not quite complete yet.</li>

<li>Support was added for software floating point routines.</li>

<li>DWARF debug information generation has been improved.  LLVM now passes 
    most of the GDB testsuite on MacOS and debug info is more dense.</li>

<li>A new register scavenger has been implemented, which is useful for
    finding free registers after register allocation.  This is useful when
    rewriting frame references on RISC targets, for example.</li>

<li>Heuristics have been added to avoid coalescing vregs with very large live 
    ranges to physregs.</li>

<li>Support now exists for very simple (but still very useful) 
    rematerialization the register allocator, enough to move  
    instructions like "load immediate" and constant pool loads.</li>

<li>Significantly improved 'switch' lowering, improving codegen for 
    sparse switches that have dense subregions, and implemented support 
    for the shift/and trick.</li>

<li>The code generator now has more accurate and general hooks for  
    describing addressing modes ("isLegalAddressingMode") to  
    optimizations like loop strength reduction and code sinking.</li>

<li>The Loop Strength Reduction pass has been improved, and support added 
    for sinking expressions across blocks to reduce register pressure.</li>

<li>Added support for tracking physreg sub-registers and super-registers 
    in the code generator, as well as extensive register  
    allocator changes to track them.</li>

<li>There is initial support for virtreg sub-registers 
    (<a href="http://llvm.org/PR1350">PR1350</a>).</li>

</ul>

<p>In addition, the LLVM target description format has itself been extended in
 several ways:</p>
 
<ul>
<li>Extended TargetData to support better target parameterization in
    the .ll/.bc files, eliminating the 'pointersize/endianness' attributes
    in the files (<a href="http://llvm.org/PR761">PR761</a>).</li>

<li>TargetData was generalized for finer grained alignment handling,
    handling of vector alignment, and handling of preferred alignment</li>

<li>LLVM now supports describing target calling conventions  
    explicitly in .td files, reducing the amount of C++ code that needs  
    to be written for a port.</li>

</ul>

</div>

<!--_________________________________________________________________________-->
<div class="doc_subsubsection"><a name="specifictargets">Target-Specific
Improvements</a></div>

<div class="doc_text">

<p>X86-Specific Code Generator Enhancements:
</p>

<ul>
<li>The scheduler was improved to better reduce register pressure on  
    X86 and other targets that are register pressure sensitive</li>
<li>Linux/x86-64 support has been improved.</li>
<li>PIC support for linux/x86 has been added.</li>
<li>Support now exists for the GCC regparm attribute, and code in the X86 
    backend to respect it.</li>
<li>Various improvements have been made for the X86-64 JIT, allowing it to
    generate code in the large code model</li>
<li>LLVM now supports inline asm with multiple constraint letters per operand 
    (like "ri") which is common in X86 inline asms.</li>
<li>Early support has been added for X86 inline asm in the C backend.</li>
<li>Added support for the X86 MMX instruction set.</li>

</ul>

<p>ARM-Specific Code Generator Enhancements:
</p>

<ul>
<li>Several improvements have been made to the ARM backend, including basic 
    inline asm support, weak linkage support, static ctor/dtor support and 
    many bug fixes.</li>
<li>There are major enhancements to the ARM backend, including support for ARM 
    v4-v6, vfp support, soft float, pre/postinc support, load/store multiple 
    generation, constant pool entry motion (to support large functions),
    and enhancements to ARM constant island pass.
    </li>
<li>Added support for Thumb code generation (an ARM subtarget).</li>
<li>More aggressive size analysis for ARM inline asm strings was 
    implemented.</li>
</ul>

<p>Other Target-Specific Code Generator Enhancements:
</p>

<ul>
<li>The PowerPC 64 JIT now supports addressing code loaded above the 2G
     boundary.</li>

<li>Improved support for the Linux/ppc ABI and the linux/ppc JIT is fully 
    functional now.  llvm-gcc and static compilation are not fully supported 
    yet though.</li>

<li>Many bugs fixed for PowerPC 64.</li>

<li>Support was added for the ARM AAPCS and EABI ABIs and PIC codegen on 
    arm/linux.</li>

<li>Several bugs in DWARF debug emission on linux and cygwin/mingw were fixed.
    Debugging basically works on these targets now.</li>

<li>Support has been added for the X86-64 large code model to the JIT,  
    which is useful if JIT'd function bodies are more than 2G away from  
    library functions.</li>

<li>Several bugs were fixed for DWARF debug info generation on arm/linux.</li>

</ul>

</div>


<!--_________________________________________________________________________-->
<div class="doc_subsubsection"><a name="other">Other Improvements</a></div>
<div class="doc_text">

<p>This release includes many other improvements, including
performance work, specifically designed to tune datastructure
usage. This makes several critical components faster.</p>

<p>More specific changes include:</p>

<ul>
<li>LLVM no longer relies on static destructors to shut itself down.  Instead,
    it lazily initializes itself and shuts down when llvm_shutdown() is 
    explicitly called.</li>

<li>LLVM now has significantly fewer static constructors, reducing startup time.
    </li>

<li>Several classes have been refactored to reduce the amount of code that
    gets linked into apps that use the JIT.</li>

<li>Construction of intrinsic function declarations has been simplified.</li>

<li>The llvm-upgrade tool now exists. This migrates LLVM 1.9 .ll files to 
    LLVM 2.0 syntax.</li>

<li>The gccas/gccld tools have been removed.</li>

<li>Support has been added to llvm-test for running on low-memory  
    or slow machines (make SMALL_PROBLEM_SIZE=1).</li>

<li>llvm-test is now more portable and should build with MS Visual Studio.</li>

</ul>
</div>

<!--_________________________________________________________________________-->
<div class="doc_subsubsection"><a name="apichanges">API Changes</a></div>
<div class="doc_text">

<p>LLVM 2.0 contains a revamp of the type system and several other significant
internal changes.  If you are programming to the C++ API, be aware of the
following major changes:</p>

<ul>
<li>Pass registration is slightly different in LLVM 2.0 (you now needs an
   intptr_t in your constructor), as explained in the <a 
   href="WritingAnLLVMPass.html#basiccode">Writing an LLVM Pass</a>
   document.</li>
   
<li><tt>ConstantBool</tt>, <tt>ConstantIntegral</tt> and <tt>ConstantInt</tt>
    classes have been merged together, we now just have
    <tt>ConstantInt</tt>.</li>

<li><tt>Type::IntTy</tt>, <tt>Type::UIntTy</tt>, <tt>Type::SByteTy</tt>, ... are
    replaced by <tt>Type::Int8Ty</tt>, <tt>Type::Int16Ty</tt>, etc.  LLVM types
    have always corresponded to fixed size types
    (e.g. long was always 64-bits), but the type system no longer includes
    information about the sign of the type.</li>

<li>Several classes (<tt>CallInst</tt>, <tt>GetElementPtrInst</tt>,
    <tt>ConstantArray</tt>, etc), that once took <tt>std::vector</tt> as
     arguments now take ranges instead.   For example, you can create a
    <tt>GetElementPtrInst</tt> with code like:
    
    <pre>
      Value *Ops[] = { Op1, Op2, Op3 };
      GEP = new GetElementPtrInst(BasePtr, Ops, 3);
    </pre>
    
    This avoids creation of a temporary vector (and a call to malloc/free).  If
    you have an std::vector, use code like this:
    <pre>
      std::vector&lt;Value*&gt; Ops = ...;
      GEP = new GetElementPtrInst(BasePtr, &amp;Ops[0], Ops.size());
    </pre>

    </li>
    
<li>CastInst is now abstract and its functionality is split into several parts,
    one for each of the <a href="LangRef.html#convertops">new cast
    instructions</a>.</li>

<li><tt>Instruction::getNext()/getPrev()</tt> are now private (along with
    <tt>BasicBlock::getNext</tt>, etc), for efficiency reasons (they are now no
    longer just simple pointers).  Please use BasicBlock::iterator, etc instead.
</li>

<li><tt>Module::getNamedFunction()</tt> is now called
    <tt>Module::getFunction()</tt>.</li>

<li><tt>SymbolTable.h</tt> has been split into <tt>ValueSymbolTable.h</tt> and 
<tt>TypeSymbolTable.h</tt>.</li>
</ul>
</div>

  <a name="portability">Portability and Supported Platforms</a>
</div>
<!-- *********************************************************************** -->

<div class="doc_text">

<p>LLVM is known to work on the following platforms:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Intel and AMD machines running Red Hat Linux, Fedora Core and FreeBSD 
      (and probably other unix-like systems).</li>
<li>Intel and AMD machines running on Win32 using MinGW libraries (native)</li>
<li>Sun UltraSPARC workstations running Solaris 8.</li>
<li>Intel and AMD machines running on Win32 with the Cygwin libraries (limited
    support is available for native builds with Visual C++).</li>

    64-bit modes.</li>
<li>Alpha-based machines running Debian GNU/Linux.</li>
<li>Itanium-based machines running Linux and HP-UX.</li>
</ul>

<p>The core LLVM infrastructure uses
<a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/autoconf/">GNU autoconf</a> to adapt itself
to the machine and operating system on which it is built.  However, minor
porting may be required to get LLVM to work on new platforms.  We welcome your

<div class="doc_subsection">
  <a name="c++-fe">Known problems with the C++ front-end</a>
</div>

<div class="doc_text">

<p>The C++ front-end is considered to be fully
tested and works for a number of non-trivial programs, including LLVM
itself, Qt, Mozilla, etc.</p>

<ul>
<li>llvm-gcc4 only has partial support for <a href="http://llvm.org/PR870">C++ 
Exception Handling</a>, and it is not enabled by default.</li>

<!-- NO EH Support!

<li>Destructors for local objects are not always run when a <tt>longjmp</tt> is
    performed. In particular, destructors for objects in the <tt>longjmp</tt>ing
    function and in the <tt>setjmp</tt> receiver function may not be run.
    Objects in intervening stack frames will be destroyed, however (which is
    better than most compilers).</li>

<li>The LLVM C++ front-end follows the <a
    href="http://www.codesourcery.com/cxx-abi">Itanium C++ ABI</a>.
    This document, which is not Itanium specific, specifies a standard for name
    mangling, class layout, v-table layout, RTTI formats, and other C++
    representation issues.  Because we use this API, code generated by the LLVM
    compilers should be binary compatible with machine code generated by other
    Itanium ABI C++ compilers (such as G++, the Intel and HP compilers, etc).
    <i>However</i>, the exception handling mechanism used by llvm-gcc3 is very
    different from the model used in the Itanium ABI, so <b>exceptions will not
    interact correctly</b>. </li>
