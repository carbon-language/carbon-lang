<div class="doc_text">

<p>This is the fourteenth public release of the LLVM Compiler Infrastructure. 
It includes a large number of features and refinements from LLVM 2.2.</p>

</div>

<!-- Unfinished features in 2.3:
  Machine LICM
  Machine Sinking

<div class="doc_subsection">
<a name="changes">Major Changes in LLVM 2.3</a>
</div>

<div class="doc_text">

<p>LLVM 2.2 was the last LLVM release to support llvm-gcc 4.0 and llvm-upgrade.
llvm-gcc 4.0 has been replaced with llvm-gcc 4.2.  llvm-upgrade was useful for
upgrading LLVM 1.9 files to LLVM 2.x syntax, but you can always use a previous
LLVM release to do this.  One nice impact of this is that the LLVM regression
test suite no longer depends on llvm-upgrade, which makes it run faster.</p>

<p><tt>llvm2cpp</tt> tool has been folded into llc, use
    <tt>llc -march=cpp</tt> instead of <tt>llvm2cpp</tt>.</p>

<p>LLVM API Changes:</p>

<ul>
<li>Several core LLVM IR classes have migrated to use 'FOOCLASS::Create(...)'
    instead of 'new FOOCLASS(...)' (e.g. where FOOCLASS=BasicBlock).  We hope to
    standardize on FOOCLASS::Create for all IR classes in the future, but not
    all of them have been moved over yet.</li>
<li>LLVM 2.3 renames the LLVMBuilder and LLVMFoldingBuilder classes to
   IRBuilder.</li>
<li>MRegisterInfo was renamed to TargetRegisterInfo.</li>
<li>The MappedFile class is gone, please use MemoryBuffer instead.</li>
<li>The '-enable-eh' flag to llc has been removed.  Now code should encode
    whether it is safe to not generate unwind information for a function by
    tagging the Function object with the 'nounwind' attribute.</li>

</ul>
</div>

<!--=========================================================================-->
<div class="doc_subsection">
<a name="majorfeatures">Major New Features</a>
</div>

<div class="doc_text">

<p>LLVM 2.3 includes several major new capabilities:</p>

<ul>
<li>Multiple Return Value Support.</li>


<li><p>LLVM 2.3 includes a complete reimplementation of the "llvmc" tool.  It is
designed to overcome several problems with the original llvmc and to provide a
superset of the features of the 'gcc' driver.</p>

<p>The main features of llvmc2 is:</p>

<ul>
<li>Extended handling of command line options and smart rules for
dispatching them to different tools.</li>
<li>Flexible (and extensible) rules for defining different tools.</li>
<li>The different intermediate steps performed by tools are represented
as edges in the abstract graph.</li>
<li>The 'language' for driver behavior definition is tablegen and thus
it's relatively easy to add new features.</li>
<li>The definition of driver is transformed into set of C++ classes, thus
no runtime interpretation is needed.</li>
</ul>
</li>


<li>Reimplemented <a href="LinkTimeOptimization.html">LTO interface</a> in
 C.</li>


<li>Kaleidoscope tutorial in Ocaml.</li>

</ul>

<div class="doc_subsection">
<a name="frontends">llvm-gcc 4.2 Improvements and Clang</a>
</div>

<div class="doc_text">

<p>LLVM 2.3 fully supports the llvm-gcc 4.2 front-end.</p>

<p>llvm-gcc 4.2 includes numerous fixes to better support the Objective-C
front-end.  Objective-C now works very well on Mac OS/X.</p>

<p>llvm-gcc 4.2 includes many other fixes which improve conformance with the
relevant parts of the GCC testsuite.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://clang.llvm.org/">clang project</a> is an effort to build
a set of new 'llvm native' front-end technologies for the LLVM optimizer
and code generator.  Currently, its C and Objective-C support is maturing 
nicely, and it has advanced source-to-source analysis and transformation
capabilities.  If you are interested in building source-level tools for C and
Objective-C (and eventually C++), you should take a look.  However, note that
clang is not an official part of the LLVM 2.3 release.  If you are interested in
this project, please see its <a href="http://clang.llvm.org/">web site</a>.</p>

<!--=========================================================================-->
<div class="doc_subsection">
<a name="coreimprovements">LLVM Core Improvements</a>
</div>

<div class="doc_text">
<p>New features include:
</p>


Common linkage?

Atomic operation support, Alpha, X86, X86-64, PowerPC. "__sync_synchronize", 
"__sync_val_compare_and_swap", etc

<ul>
<li>The C and Ocaml bindings have received additional improvements. The
bindings now cover pass managers, several transformation passes, iteration
over the LLVM IR, target data, and parameter attribute lists.</li>
</ul>
  
</div>

<!--=========================================================================-->
<div class="doc_subsection">
<a name="optimizer">Optimizer Improvements</a>
</div>

<div class="doc_text">

<p>In addition to a huge array of bug fixes and minor performance tweaks, the 
LLVM 2.3 optimizers support a few major enhancements:</p>

<ul>

<li>Loop index set splitting on by default.<p>
This transformation hoists conditions from loop bodies and reduces loop's
iteration space to improve performance. For example, <p>
<pre>
for (i = LB; i &lt; UB; ++i)
  if (i &lt;= NV)
    LOOP_BODY
</pre>
is transformed into
<pre>
NUB = min(NV+1, UB)
for (i = LB; i &lt; NUB; ++i)
  LOOP_BODY
</pre>
</li>

<li>LLVM includes a new <tt>memcpy</tt> optimization pass removes
dead <tt>memcpy</tt> calls, unneeded copies of aggregates, and performs
return slot optimization.  The LLVM optimizer now notices long sequences of
consecutive stores and merges them into <tt>memcpy</tt>'s where profitable.</li>

<li>Alignment detection for vector memory references and for <tt>memcpy</tt> and
<tt>memset</tt> is now more aggressive.</li> 

<li>The aggressive dead code elimination (ADCE) optimization has been rewritten
to make it both faster and safer in the presence of code containing infinite
loops.  Some of its prior functionality has been factored out into the loop
deletion pass, which <em>is</em> safe for infinite loops.</li>

<li>Several optimizations have been sped up, leading to faster code generation
    with the same code quality.</li>
    
<li>The 'SimplifyLibCalls' pass, which optimizes calls to libc and libm
    functions for C-based languages, has been rewritten to be a FunctionPass
    instead a ModulePass.  This allows it to be run more often and to be
    included at -O1 in llvm-gcc.  It was also extended to include more
    optimizations and several corner case bugs were fixed.</li>

<li>LLVM now includes a simple 'Jump Threading' pass, which attempts to simplify
    conditional branches using information about predecessor blocks, simplifying
    the control flow graph.  This pass is pretty basic at this point, but
    catches some important cases and provides a foundation to build on.</li>
    
<li>Several corner case bugs which could lead to deleting volatile memory
    accesses have been fixed.</li>
</ul>

</div>

<!--=========================================================================-->
<div class="doc_subsection">
<a name="codegen">Code Generator Improvements</a>
</div>

<div class="doc_text">

<p>We put a significant amount of work into the code generator infrastructure,
which allows us to implement more aggressive algorithms and make it run
faster:</p>

<ul>
<li>MemOperand in the code generator: describe me!.</li>

<li>The target-independent code generator infrastructure now uses LLVM's APInt
    class to handle integer values, which allows it to support integer types
    larger than 64 bits. Note that support for such types is also dependent on
    target-specific support. Use of APInt is also a step toward support for
    non-power-of-2 integer sizes.</li>
    
<li>LLVM 2.3 includes several compile time speedups for code with large basic
    blocks, particular in the instruction selection phase, register allocation,
    scheduling, and tail merging/jump threading.</li>

<li>Several improvements which make llc's <tt>--view-sunit-dags</tt>
    visualization of scheduling dependency graphs easier to understand.</li>
    
<li>The code generator allows targets to write patterns that generate subreg
    references directly in .td files now.</li>
    
<li><tt>memcpy</tt> lowering in the backend is more aggressive, particularly for
    <tt>memcpy</tt> calls introduced by the code generator when handling
    pass-by-value structure argument copies.</li>
    
<li>Inline assembly with multiple register results now returns those results
    directly in the appropriate registers, rather than going through memory.
    Inline assembly that uses constraints like "ir" with immediates now use the
    'i' form when possible instead of always loading the value in a register.
    This saves an instruction and reduces register use.</li>

<li>Added support for PIC/GOT style tail calls on x86/32 and initial support
    for tail calls on PowerPC 32 (it may also work on ppc64 but not
    thoroughly tested).</li>
</ul>

</div>


<!--=========================================================================-->
<div class="doc_subsection">
<a name="x86specific">X86/X86-64 Specific Improvements</a>
</div>

<div class="doc_text">
<p>New target-specific features include:
</p>

<ul>
<li>llvm-gcc's X86-64 ABI conformance is far improved, particularly in the
    area of passing and returning structures by value.  llvm-gcc compiled code
    now interoperates very well on X86-64 systems with other compilers.</li>

<li>Support for Win64 was added. This includes code generation itself, JIT
    support and necessary changes to llvm-gcc.</li>

<li>The LLVM X86 backend now supports the support SSE 4.1 instruction set, and
    the llvm-gcc 4.2 front-end supports the SSE 4.1 compiler builtins.  Various
    generic vector operations (insert/extract/shuffle) are much more efficient
    when SSE 4.1 is enabled.  The JIT automatically takes advantage of these
    instructions, but llvm-gcc must be explicitly told to use them, e.g. with
    <tt>-march=penryn</tt>.</li>

<li>The X86 backend now does a number of optimizations that aim to avoid
    converting numbers back and forth from SSE registers to the X87 floating
    point stack.</li>

<li>The X86 backend supports stack realignment, which is particularly useful for
    vector code on OS's without 16-byte aligned stacks.</li>

<li>The X86 backend now supports the "sseregparm" options in GCC, which allow
    functions to be tagged as passing floating point values in SSE
    registers.</li>

<li>Trampolines (taking the address of a nested function) now work on
    Linux/X86-64.</li>

<li><tt>__builtin_prefetch</tt> is now compiled into the appropriate prefetch
    instructions instead of being ignored.</li>

<li>128-bit integers are now supported on X86-64 targets.</li>

<li>The register allocator can now rematerialize PIC-base computations.</li>

<li>The "t" and "f" inline assembly constraints for the X87 floating point stack
    now work.  However, the "u" constraint is still not fully supported.</li>

</ul>

  <a name="portability">Portability and Supported Platforms</a>
</div>
<!-- *********************************************************************** -->

<div class="doc_text">

<p>LLVM is known to work on the following platforms:</p>

<ul>
<li>Intel and AMD machines (IA32) running Red Hat Linux, Fedora Core and FreeBSD 
      (and probably other unix-like systems).</li>
<li>PowerPC and X86-based Mac OS X systems, running 10.3 and above in 32-bit and
    64-bit modes.</li>
<li>Intel and AMD machines running on Win32 using MinGW libraries (native).</li>
<li>Intel and AMD machines running on Win32 with the Cygwin libraries (limited
    support is available for native builds with Visual C++).</li>
<li>Sun UltraSPARC workstations running Solaris 10.</li>
<li>Alpha-based machines running Debian GNU/Linux.</li>
<li>Itanium-based (IA64) machines running Linux and HP-UX.</li>
</ul>

<p>The core LLVM infrastructure uses GNU autoconf to adapt itself
to the machine and operating system on which it is built.  However, minor
porting may be required to get LLVM to work on new platforms.  We welcome your
portability patches and reports of successful builds or error messages.</p>

when building C++ programs using the C back-end.)</li>

<li>The C++ front-end does not use <a href="http://llvm.org/PR406">IA64
ABI compliant layout of v-tables</a>.  In particular, it just stores function
pointers instead of function descriptors in the vtable.  This bug prevents
mixing C++ code compiled with LLVM with C++ objects compiled by other C++

</div>

<div class="doc_text">
The llvm-gcc 4.2 Ada compiler works fairly well, however this is not a mature
technology and problems should be expected.
<ul>
<li>The Ada front-end currently only builds on X86-32.  This is mainly due
to lack of trampoline support (pointers to nested functions) on other platforms,
however it <a href="http://llvm.org/PR2006">also fails to build on X86-64</a>
which does support trampolines.</li>
<li>The Ada front-end <a href="http://llvm.org/PR2007">fails to bootstrap</a>.
Workaround: configure with --disable-bootstrap.</li>
<li>The c380004 and <a href="http://llvm.org/PR2010">c393010</a> ACATS tests
fail (c380004 also fails with gcc-4.2 mainline).  When built at -O3, the
<a href="http://llvm.org/PR2421">cxg2021</a> ACATS test also fails.</li>
<li>Some gcc specific Ada tests continue to crash the compiler.  The testsuite
reports most tests as having failed even though they pass.</li>
<li>The -E binder option (exception backtraces)
<a href="http://llvm.org/PR1982">does not work</a> and will result in programs
crashing if an exception is raised.  Workaround: do not use -E.</li>
<li>Only discrete types <a href="http://llvm.org/PR1981">are allowed to start

or use representation clauses that result in a field of a non-discrete type
starting or finishing in the middle of a byte.</li>
<li>The <tt>lli</tt> interpreter <a href="http://llvm.org/PR2009">considers
'main' as generated by the Ada binder to be invalid</a>.
