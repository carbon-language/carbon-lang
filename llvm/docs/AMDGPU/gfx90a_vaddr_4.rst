.. _amdgpu_synid_gfx90a_vaddr_4:

vaddr
=====

Image address which includes from one to four dimensional coordinates and other data used to locate a position in the image.

*Size:* 1, 2, 3, 4, 8 or 16 dwords. Actual size depends on opcode, specific image being handled and :ref:`a16<amdgpu_synid_a16>`.

  Note 1. Image format and dimensions are encoded in the image resource constant but not in the instruction.

  Note 2. Actually image address size may vary from 1 to 13 dwords, but assembler currently supports a limited range of register sequences.

*Operands:* :ref:`v<amdgpu_synid_v>`
