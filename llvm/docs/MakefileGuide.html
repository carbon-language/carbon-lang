  <p>This document provides <em>usage</em> information about the LLVM makefile 
  system. While loosely patterned after the BSD makefile system, LLVM has taken 
  a departure from BSD in order to implement additional features needed by LLVM.
  Although makefile systems such as automake were attempted at one point, it
  has become clear that the features needed by LLVM and the Makefile norm are 
  too great to use a more limited tool. Consequently, LLVM requires simply GNU 
  Make 3.79, a widely portable makefile processor. LLVM unabashedly makes heavy 
  use of the features of GNU Make so the dependency on GNU Make is firm. If 
  you're not familiar with <tt>make</tt>, it is recommended that you read the 
  <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html">GNU Makefile 
  Manual</a>.</p>
  <p>While this document is rightly part of the 
  <a href="ProgrammersManual.html">LLVM Programmer's Manual</a>, it is treated
  separately here because of the volume of content and because it is often an
  early source of bewilderment for new developers.</p>

<div class="doc_text">
  <p>The LLVM Makefile System is the component of LLVM that is responsible for
  building the software, testing it,  generating distributions, checking those
  distributions, installing and uninstalling, etc. It consists of a several
  files throughout the source tree. These files and other general concepts are
  described in this section.</p>
</div>

<!-- ======================================================================= -->
<div class="doc_subsection"><a name="projects">Projects</a></div>
<div class="doc_text">
  <p>The LLVM Makefile System is quite generous. It not only builds its own
  software, but it can build yours too. Built into the system is knowledge of
  the <tt>llvm/projects</tt> directory. Any directory under <tt>projects</tt>
  that has both a <tt>configure</tt> script and a <tt>Makefile</tt> is assumed
  to be a project that uses the LLVM Makefile system.  Building software that
  uses LLVM does not require the LLVM Makefile System nor even placement in the
  <tt>llvm/projects</tt> directory. However, doing so will allow your project
  to get up and running quickly by utilizing the built-in features that are used
  to compile LLVM. LLVM compiles itself using the same features of the makefile
  system as used for projects.</p>
  <p>For complete details on setting up your projects configuration, simply
  mimic the <tt>llvm/projects/sample</tt> project or for further details, 
  consult the <a href="Projects.html">Projects.html</a> page.</p>
</div>

<!-- ======================================================================= -->
<div class="doc_subsection"><a name="varvalues">Variable Values</a></div>
<div class="doc_text">
  <p>To use the makefile system, you simply create a file named 
  <tt>Makefile</tt> in your directory and declare values for certain variables. 
  The variables and values that you select determine what the makefile system
  will do. These variables enable rules and processing in the makefile system
  that automatically Do The Right Thing&trade;.

<!-- ======================================================================= -->
<div class="doc_subsection"><a name="including">Including Makefiles</a></div>

  <p>Setting variables alone is not enough. You must include into your Makefile
  additional files that provide the rules of the LLVM Makefile system. The

<div class="doc_text">
  <p>This section provides some examples of the different kinds of modules you
  can build with the LLVM makefile system. In general, each directory you 
  provide will build a single object although that object may be composed of
  additionally compiled components.</p>
</div>

<!-- ======================================================================= -->
<div class="doc_subsection"><a name="libraries">Libraries</a></div>
<div class="doc_text">
  <p>Only a few variable definitions are needed to build a regular library.
  Normally, the makefile system will build all the software into a single
  <tt>libname.o</tt> (pre-linked) object. This means the library is not
  searchable and that the distinction between compilation units has been
  dissolved. Optionally, you can ask for a shared library (.so) or archive
  library (.a) built.  Archive libraries are the default. For example:</p>
  <pre><tt>
      LIBRARYNAME = mylib
      SHARED_LIBRARY = 1
      ARCHIVE_LIBRARY = 1
  </tt></pre>
  <p>says to build a library named "mylib" with both a shared library 
  (<tt>mylib.so</tt>) and an archive library (<tt>mylib.a</tt>) version. The
  contents of all the
  libraries produced will be the same, they are just constructed differently.
  Note that you normally do not need to specify the sources involved. The LLVM
  Makefile system will infer the source files from the contents of the source
  directory.</p>
  <p>The <tt>LOADABLE_MODULE=1</tt> directive can be used in conjunction with
  <tt>SHARED_LIBRARY=1</tt> to indicate that the resulting shared library should
  be openable with the <tt>dlopen</tt> function and searchable with the
  <tt>dlsym</tt> function (or your operating system's equivalents). While this
  isn't strictly necessary on Linux and a few other platforms, it is required
  on systems like HP-UX and Darwin. You should use <tt>LOADABLE_MODULE</tt> for
  any shared library that you intend to be loaded into an tool via the
  <tt>-load</tt> option. See the 
  <a href="WritingAnLLVMPass.html#makefile">WritingAnLLVMPass.html</a> document
  for an example of why you might want to do this.
</div>

<!-- ======================================================================= -->
<div class="doc_subsubsection"><a name="BCModules">Bitcode Modules</a></div>
<div class="doc_text">
  <p>In some situations, it is desirable to build a single bitcode module from
  a variety of sources, instead of an archive, shared library, or bitcode 
  library. Bitcode modules can be specified in addition to any of the other
  types of libraries by defining the <a href="#MODULE_NAME">MODULE_NAME</a>
  variable. For example:</p>
  <pre><tt>
      LIBRARYNAME = mylib
      BYTECODE_LIBRARY = 1
      MODULE_NAME = mymod
  </tt></pre>
  <p>will build a module named <tt>mymod.bc</tt> from the sources in the
  directory. This module will be an aggregation of all the bitcode modules 
  derived from the sources. The example will also build a bitcode archive 
  containing a bitcode module for each compiled source file. The difference is
  subtle, but important depending on how the module or library is to be linked.
  </p>
</div>

<!-- ======================================================================= -->
<div class="doc_subsubsection">
  <a name="LoadableModules">Loadable Modules</a>
</div>
<div class="doc_text">
  <p>In some situations, you need to create a loadable module. Loadable modules
  can be loaded into programs like <tt>opt</tt> or <tt>llc</tt> to specify
  additional passes to run or targets to support.  Loadable modules are also
  useful for debugging a pass or providing a pass with another package if that
  pass can't be included in LLVM.</p>
  <p>LLVM provides complete support for building such a module. All you need to
  do is use the LOADABLE_MODULE variable in your Makefile. For example, to 
  build a loadable module named <tt>MyMod</tt> that uses the LLVM libraries
  <tt>LLVMSupport.a</tt> and <tt>LLVMSystem.a</tt>, you would specify:</p>
  <pre><tt>
     LIBRARYNAME := MyMod
     LOADABLE_MODULE := 1
     LINK_COMPONENTS := support system
  </tt></pre>
  <p>Use of the <tt>LOADABLE_MODULE</tt> facility implies several things:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>There will be no "lib" prefix on the module. This differentiates it from
    a standard shared library of the same name.</li>
    <li>The <a href="#SHARED_LIBRARY">SHARED_LIBRARY</a> variable is turned 
    on.</li>
    <li>The <a href="#LINK_LIBS_IN_SHARED">LINK_LIBS_IN_SHARED</a> variable
    is turned on.</li>
  </ol>
  <p>A loadable module is loaded by LLVM via the facilities of libtool's libltdl
  library which is part of <tt>lib/System</tt> implementation.</p>
</div>

<!-- ======================================================================= -->
<div class="doc_subsection"><a name="tools">Tools</a></div>
<div class="doc_text">
  <p>For building executable programs (tools), you must provide the name of the
  tool and the names of the libraries you wish to link with the tool. For
  example:</p>
  <pre><tt>
      TOOLNAME = mytool
      USEDLIBS = mylib
      LINK_COMPONENTS = support system
  </tt></pre>
  <p>says that we are to build a tool name <tt>mytool</tt> and that it requires
  three libraries: <tt>mylib</tt>, <tt>LLVMSupport.a</tt> and
  <tt>LLVMSystem.a</tt>.</p>
  <p>Note that two different variables are use to indicate which libraries are
  linked: <tt>USEDLIBS</tt> and <tt>LLVMLIBS</tt>. This distinction is necessary
  to support projects. <tt>LLVMLIBS</tt> refers to the LLVM libraries found in 
  the LLVM object directory. <tt>USEDLIBS</tt> refers to the libraries built by 
  your project. In the case of building LLVM tools, <tt>USEDLIBS</tt> and 
  <tt>LLVMLIBS</tt> can be used interchangeably since the "project" is LLVM 
  itself and <tt>USEDLIBS</tt> refers to the same place as <tt>LLVMLIBS</tt>.
  </p>
  <p>Also note that there are two different ways of specifying a library: with a
  <tt>.a</tt> suffix and without. Without the suffix, the entry refers to the
  re-linked (.o) file which will include <em>all</em> symbols of the library.
  This is useful, for example, to include all passes from a library of passes.
  If the <tt>.a</tt> suffix is used then the library is linked as a searchable
  library (with the <tt>-l</tt> option). In this case, only the symbols that are
  unresolved <em>at that point</em> will be resolved from the library, if they
  exist. Other (unreferenced) symbols will not be included when the <tt>.a</tt>
  syntax is used. Note that in order to use the <tt>.a</tt> suffix, the library
  in question must have been built with the <tt>ARCHIVE_LIBRARY</tt> option set.
  </p>
</div>

<!-- ======================================================================= -->
<div class="doc_subsubsection"><a name="JIT">JIT Tools</a></div>
<div class="doc_text">
  <p>Many tools will want to use the JIT features of LLVM.  To do this, you
     simply specify that you want an execution 'engine', and the makefiles will
     automatically link in the appropriate JIT for the host or an interpreter
     if none is available:</p>
  <pre><tt>
      TOOLNAME = my_jit_tool
      USEDLIBS = mylib
      LINK_COMPONENTS = engine
  </tt></pre>
  <p>Of course, any additional libraries may be listed as other components.  To
  get a full understanding of how this changes the linker command, it is
  recommended that you:</p>
  <pre><tt>
      cd examples/Fibonacci
      make VERBOSE=1

    <dd>If set to 1, causes the build to disable assertions, even if

    <dt><a name="KEEP_SYMBOLS"><tt>KEEP_SYMBOLS</tt></a></dt>
    <dd>If set to any value, specifies that when linking executables the

    tool. Unlike <tt>USEDLIBS</tt> and <tt>LLVMLIBS</tt>, not all libraries need

    <dt><a name="LOADABLE_MODULE"><tt>LOADABLE_MODULE</tt></a></dt>
    <dd>If set to any value, causes the shared library being built to also be
    a loadable module. Loadable modules can be opened with the dlopen() function
    and searched with dlsym (or the operating system's equivalent). Note that
    setting this variable without also setting <tt>SHARED_LIBRARY</tt> will have
    no effect.</dd>
    <dt><a name="MODULE_NAME"><tt>MODULE_NAME</tt></a></dt>
    <dd>Specifies the name of a bitcode module to be created. A bitcode 
    module can be specified in conjunction with other kinds of library builds 
    or by itself. It constructs from the sources a single linked bitcode 
    file.</dd>
    <dt><a name="NO_INSTALL"><tt>NO_INSTALL</tt></a></dt>
    <dd>Specifies that the build products of the directory should not be
    installed but should be built even if the <tt>install</tt> target is given.
    This is handy for directories that build libraries or tools that are only
    used as part of the build process, such as code generators (e.g.
    <tt>tblgen</tt>).</dd>
    <dt><a name="OPTIONAL_DIRS"><tt>OPTIONAL_DIRS</tt></a></dt>

    <dd>Specify a set of directories to build recursively and in parallel if
    the -j option was used with <tt>make</tt>.</dd>
    <dt><a name="SHARED_LIBRARY"><tt>SHARED_LIBRARY</tt></a></dt>
    <dd>If set to any value, causes a shared library (.so) to be built in
    addition to any other kinds of libraries. Note that this option will cause
    all source files to be built twice: once with options for position
    independent code and once without. Use it only where you really need a
    shared library.</dd>
    <dt><a name="SOURCES"><tt>SOURCES</tt><small>(optional)</small></a></dt>
    <dd>Specifies the list of source files in the current directory to be
    built. Source files of any type may be specified (programs, documentation, 
    config files, etc.). If not specified, the makefile system will infer the
    set of source files from the files present in the current directory.</dd>
    <dt><a name="SUFFIXES"><tt>SUFFIXES</tt></a></dt>
    <dd>Specifies a set of filename suffixes that occur in suffix match rules.
    Only set this if your local <tt>Makefile</tt> specifies additional suffix
    match rules.</dd> 
    <dt><a name="TARGET"><tt>TARGET</tt></a></dt>
    <dd>Specifies the name of the LLVM code generation target that the
    current directory builds. Setting this variable enables additional rules to
    build <tt>.inc</tt> files from <tt>.td</tt> files. </dd>
    <dt><a name="TESTSUITE"><tt>TESTSUITE</tt></a></dt>
    <dd>Specifies the directory of tests to run in <tt>llvm/test</tt>.</dd>
    <dt><a name="TOOLNAME"><tt>TOOLNAME</tt></a></dt>
    <dd>Specifies the name of the tool that the current directory should
    build.</dd>
    <dt><a name="TOOL_VERBOSE"><tt>TOOL_VERBOSE</tt></a></dt>
    <dd>Implies VERBOSE and also tells each tool invoked to be verbose. This is
    handy when you're trying to see the sub-tools invoked by each tool invoked 
    by the makefile. For example, this will pass <tt>-v</tt> to the GCC 
    compilers which causes it to print out the command lines it uses to invoke
    sub-tools (compiler, assembler, linker).</dd>
    <dt><a name="USEDLIBS"><tt>USEDLIBS</tt></a></dt>
    <dd>Specifies the list of project libraries that will be linked into the
    tool or library.</dd>
    <dt><a name="VERBOSE"><tt>VERBOSE</tt></a></dt>
    <dd>Tells the Makefile system to produce detailed output of what it is doing
    instead of just summary comments. This will generate a LOT of output.</dd>
