   ReleaseNotes

:doc:`Projects`
  How-to guide and templates for new projects that *use* the LLVM

  tree) allow the project code to be located outside (or inside) the ``llvm/``
  tree, while using LLVM header files and libraries.

:doc:`HowToReleaseLLVM`
  This is a guide to preparing LLVM releases. Most developers can ignore it.

:doc:`ReleaseProcess`

:doc:`HowToAddABuilder`
   Instructions for adding new builder to LLVM buildbot master.

:doc:`Packaging`

:doc:`Release notes for the current release <ReleaseNotes>`
   This describes new features, known bugs, and other limitations.

.. _lists-forums:

Forums & Mailing Lists
----------------------

If you can't find what you need in these docs, try consulting the
Discourse forums. There are also commit mailing lists for all commits to the LLVM Project.

`LLVM Discourse`__
  The forums for all things LLVM and related sub-projects. There are categories and subcategories for a wide variety of areas within LLVM. You can also view tags or search for a specific topic. 

  .. __: https://discourse.llvm.org/

`Commits Archive (llvm-commits)`__
  This list contains all commit messages that are made when LLVM developers
  commit code changes to the repository. It also serves as a forum for
  patch review (i.e. send patches here). It is useful for those who want to
  stay on the bleeding edge of LLVM development. This list is very high
  volume.

  .. __: http://lists.llvm.org/pipermail/llvm-commits/

`Bugs & Patches Archive (llvm-bugs)`__
  This list gets emailed every time a bug is opened and closed. It is
  higher volume than the LLVM-dev list.

  .. __: http://lists.llvm.org/pipermail/llvm-bugs/

`LLVM Announcements`__
  If you just want project wide announcements such as releases, developers meetings, or blog posts, then you should check out the Announcement category on LLVM Discourse. 

  .. __: https://discourse.llvm.org/c/announce/46 

.. _online-sync-ups:

Online Sync-Ups
---------------

A number of regular calls are organized on specific topics. It should be
expected that the range of topics will change over time. At the time of
writing, the following sync-ups are organized:

Office hours
------------

A number of experienced LLVM contributors make themselves available for a chat
on a regular schedule, to anyone who is looking for some guidance. Please find
the list of who is available when, through which medium, and what their area of
