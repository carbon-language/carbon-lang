<p>In order to use the LLVM test suite, you will need all of the software
required to build LLVM, plus the following:</p>

<dl>
<dt><a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/dejagnu/">DejaGNU</a></dt>
<dd>The Feature and Regressions tests are organized and run by DejaGNU.</dd>
<dt><a href="http://expect.nist.gov/">Expect</a></dt>
<dd>Expect is required by DejaGNU.</dd>
<dt><a href="http://www.tcl.tk/software/tcltk/">tcl</a></dt>
<dd>Tcl is required by DejaGNU. </dd>

<dt><a href="http://www.netlib.org/f2c">F2C</a></dt>
<dd>For now, LLVM does not have a Fortran front-end, but using F2C, we can run
Fortran benchmarks.  F2C support must be enabled via <tt>configure</tt> if not
installed in a standard place.  F2C requires three items: the <tt>f2c</tt>
executable, <tt>f2c.h</tt> to compile the generated code, and <tt>libf2c.a</tt>
to link generated code.  By default, given an F2C directory <tt>$DIR</tt>, the
configure script will search <tt>$DIR/bin</tt> for <tt>f2c</tt>,
<tt>$DIR/include</tt> for <tt>f2c.h</tt>, and <tt>$DIR/lib</tt> for
<tt>libf2c.a</tt>.  The default <tt>$DIR</tt> values are: <tt>/usr</tt>,
<tt>/usr/local</tt>, <tt>/sw</tt>, and <tt>/opt</tt>.  If you installed F2C in a
different location, you must tell <tt>configure</tt>:

<ul>
<li><tt>./configure --with-f2c=$DIR</tt><br>
This will specify a new <tt>$DIR</tt> for the above-described search
process.  This will only work if the binary, header, and library are in their
respective subdirectories of <tt>$DIR</tt>.</li>

<li><tt>./configure --with-f2c-bin=/binary/path --with-f2c-inc=/include/path
--with-f2c-lib=/lib/path</tt><br>
This allows you to specify the F2C components separately.  Note: if you choose
this route, you MUST specify all three components, and you need to only specify
<em>directories</em> where the files are located; do NOT include the
filenames themselves on the <tt>configure</tt> line.</li>
</ul></dd>
</dl>

<p>Darwin (Mac OS X) developers can simplify the installation of Expect and tcl
by using fink.  <tt>fink install expect</tt> will install both. Alternatively,
Darwinports users can use <tt>sudo port install expect</tt> to install Expect
and tcl.</p>

<div class="doc_text">

  <p>The tests are located in two separate Subversion modules. The basic feature
  and regression tests are in the main "llvm" module under the directory 
  <tt>llvm/test</tt>. A more comprehensive test suite that includes whole 
programs in C and C++ is in the <tt>test-suite</tt> module. This module should 
be checked out to the <tt>llvm/projects</tt> directory as llvm-test (for
historical purpose).  When you <tt>configure</tt> the <tt>llvm</tt> module, 
the <tt>llvm-test</tt> directory will be automatically configured. 
Alternatively, you can configure the <tt>test-suite</tt> module manually.</p>
<p>To run all of the simple tests in LLVM using DejaGNU, use the master Makefile
 in the <tt>llvm/test</tt> directory:</p>

<div class="doc_code">
<pre>
% gmake -C llvm/test
</pre>
</div>

<p>or</p>

<div class="doc_code">
<pre>
% gmake check
</pre>
</div>

<p>To run only a subdirectory of tests in llvm/test using DejaGNU (ie.
Regression/Transforms), just set the TESTSUITE variable to the path of the
subdirectory (relative to <tt>llvm/test</tt>):</p>

<div class="doc_code">
<pre>
% gmake -C llvm/test TESTSUITE=Regression/Transforms
</pre>
</div>

<p><b>Note: If you are running the tests with <tt>objdir != subdir</tt>, you
must have run the complete testsuite before you can specify a
subdirectory.</b></p>

<p>To run the comprehensive test suite (tests that compile and execute whole 
programs), run the <tt>llvm-test</tt> tests:</p>

<div class="doc_code">
<pre>
% cd llvm/projects
% svn co http://llvm.org/svn/llvm-project/test-suite/trunk llvm-test
% cd ..
% ./configure --with-llvmgccdir=$LLVM_GCC_DIR
% cd projects/llvm-test
% gmake
</pre>
<p>where <tt>$LLVM_GCC_DIR</tt> is the directory where you <em>installed</em>
llvm-gcc, not it's src or obj dir.</p>

<div class="doc_text">

<p>The LLVM test suite contains two major categories of tests: code
fragments and whole programs. Code fragments are in the <tt>llvm</tt> module
under the <tt>llvm/test</tt> directory. The whole programs
test suite is in the <tt>llvm-test</tt> module under the main directory.</p>

</div>

<!-- _______________________________________________________________________ -->
<div class="doc_subsection"><a name="codefragments">Code Fragments</a></div>
<!-- _______________________________________________________________________ -->

<div class="doc_text">

<p>Code fragments are small pieces of code that test a specific feature of LLVM
or trigger a specific bug in LLVM.  They are usually written in LLVM assembly
language, but can be written in other languages if the test targets a particular
language front end.</p>

<p>Code fragments are not complete programs, and they are never executed to
determine correct behavior.</p> 

<p>These code fragment tests are located in the <tt>llvm/test/Features</tt> and 
<tt>llvm/test/Regression</tt> directories.</p>

</div>

<!-- _______________________________________________________________________ -->
<div class="doc_subsection"><a name="wholeprograms">Whole Programs</a></div>
<!-- _______________________________________________________________________ -->

<div class="doc_text">

<p>Whole Programs are pieces of code which can be compiled and linked into a
stand-alone program that can be executed.  These programs are generally written
in high level languages such as C or C++, but sometimes they are written
straight in LLVM assembly.</p>

<p>These programs are compiled and then executed using several different
methods (native compiler, LLVM C backend, LLVM JIT, LLVM native code generation,
etc).  The output of these programs is compared to ensure that LLVM is compiling
the program correctly.</p>

<p>In addition to compiling and executing programs, whole program tests serve as
a way of benchmarking LLVM performance, both in terms of the efficiency of the
programs generated as well as the speed with which LLVM compiles, optimizes, and
generates code.</p>

<p>All "whole program" tests are located in the <tt>test-suite</tt> Subversion
module.</p> 

</div>

<!--=========================================================================-->
<div class="doc_section"><a name="tree">LLVM Test Suite Tree</a></div>
<!--=========================================================================-->

<div class="doc_text">

<p>Each type of test in the LLVM test suite has its own directory. The major
subtrees of the test suite directory tree are as follows:</p>
    
<ul>
  <li><tt>llvm/test</tt>
  <p>This directory contains a large array of small tests
  that exercise various features of LLVM and to ensure that regressions do not
  occur. The directory is broken into several sub-directories, each focused on
  a particular area of LLVM. A few of the important ones are:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><tt>Analysis</tt>: checks Analysis passes.</li>
    <li><tt>Archive</tt>: checks the Archive library.</li>
    <li><tt>Assembler</tt>: checks Assembly reader/writer functionality.</li>
    <li><tt>Bitcode</tt>: checks Bitcode reader/writer functionality.</li>
    <li><tt>CodeGen</tt>: checks code generation and each target.</li>
    <li><tt>Features</tt>: checks various features of the LLVM language.</li>
    <li><tt>Linker</tt>: tests bitcode linking.</li>
    <li><tt>Transforms</tt>: tests each of the scalar, IPO, and utility
    transforms to ensure they make the right transformations.</li>
    <li><tt>Verifier</tt>: tests the IR verifier.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Typically when a bug is found in LLVM, a regression test containing 
  just enough code to reproduce the problem should be written and placed 
  somewhere underneath this directory.  In most cases, this will be a small 
  piece of LLVM assembly language code, often distilled from an actual 
  application or benchmark.</p></li>

<li><tt>test-suite</tt>
<p>The <tt>test-suite</tt> module contains programs that can be compiled 
with LLVM and executed.  These programs are compiled using the native compiler
and various LLVM backends.  The output from the program compiled with the 
native compiler is assumed correct; the results from the other programs are
compared to the native program output and pass if they match.</p>

<p>In addition for testing correctness, the <tt>llvm-test</tt> directory also
performs timing tests of various LLVM optimizations.  It also records
compilation times for the compilers and the JIT.  This information can be
used to compare the effectiveness of LLVM's optimizations and code
generation.</p></li>

<li><tt>llvm-test/SingleSource</tt>
<p>The SingleSource directory contains test programs that are only a single 
source file in size.  These are usually small benchmark programs or small 
programs that calculate a particular value.  Several such programs are grouped 
together in each directory.</p></li>

<li><tt>llvm-test/MultiSource</tt>
<p>The MultiSource directory contains subdirectories which contain entire 
programs with multiple source files.  Large benchmarks and whole applications 
go here.</p></li>

<li><tt>llvm-test/External</tt>
<p>The External directory contains Makefiles for building code that is external
to (i.e., not distributed with) LLVM.  The most prominent members of this
directory are the SPEC 95 and SPEC 2000 benchmark suites.  The presence and
location of these external programs is configured by the llvm-test
<tt>configure</tt> script.</p></li>
      
</ul>

</div>
<!--=========================================================================-->
<div class="doc_section"><a name="dgstructure">DejaGNU Structure</a></div>
<!--=========================================================================-->
<div class="doc_text">
  <p>The LLVM test suite is partially driven by DejaGNU and partially driven by 
  GNU Make. Specifically, the Features and Regression tests are all driven by 
  DejaGNU. The <tt>llvm-test</tt> module is currently driven by a set of 
  Makefiles.</p>

  <p>The DejaGNU structure is very simple, but does require some information to 
  be set. This information is gathered via <tt>configure</tt> and is written 
  to a file, <tt>site.exp</tt> in <tt>llvm/test</tt>. The <tt>llvm/test</tt> 
  Makefile does this work for you.</p>

  <p>In order for DejaGNU to work, each directory of tests must have a 
  <tt>dg.exp</tt> file. DejaGNU looks for this file to determine how to run the
  tests. This file is just a Tcl script and it can do anything you want, but 
  we've standardized it for the LLVM regression tests. It simply loads a Tcl 
  library (<tt>test/lib/llvm.exp</tt>) and calls the <tt>llvm_runtests</tt> 
  function defined in that library with a list of file names to run. The names 
  are obtained by using Tcl's glob command.  Any directory that contains only
  directories does not need the <tt>dg.exp</tt> file.</p>

  <p>The <tt>llvm-runtests</tt> function lookas at each file that is passed to
  it and gathers any lines together that match "RUN:". This are the "RUN" lines
  that specify how the test is to be run. So, each test script must contain
  RUN lines if it is to do anything. If there are no RUN lines, the
  <tt>llvm-runtests</tt> function will issue an error and the test will
  fail.</p>

  <p>RUN lines are specified in the comments of the test program using the 
  keyword <tt>RUN</tt> followed by a colon, and lastly the command (pipeline) 
  to execute.  Together, these lines form the "script" that 
  <tt>llvm-runtests</tt> executes to run the test case.  The syntax of the
  RUN lines is similar to a shell's syntax for pipelines including I/O
  redirection and variable substitution.  However, even though these lines 
  may <i>look</i> like a shell script, they are not. RUN lines are interpreted 
  directly by the Tcl <tt>exec</tt> command. They are never executed by a 
  shell. Consequently the syntax differs from normal shell script syntax in a 
  few ways.  You can specify as many RUN lines as needed.</p>

  <p>Each RUN line is executed on its own, distinct from other lines unless
  its last character is <tt>\</tt>. This continuation character causes the RUN
  line to be concatenated with the next one. In this way you can build up long
  pipelines of commands without making huge line lengths. The lines ending in
  <tt>\</tt> are concatenated until a RUN line that doesn't end in <tt>\</tt> is
  found. This concatenated set or RUN lines then constitutes one execution. 
  Tcl will substitute variables and arrange for the pipeline to be executed. If
  any process in the pipeline fails, the entire line (and test case) fails too.
  </p>

  <p> Below is an example of legal RUN lines in a <tt>.ll</tt> file:</p>

<div class="doc_code">
<pre>
; RUN: llvm-as &lt; %s | llvm-dis &gt; %t1
; RUN: llvm-dis &lt; %s.bc-13 &gt; %t2
; RUN: diff %t1 %t2
</pre>
</div>

  <p>As with a Unix shell, the RUN: lines permit pipelines and I/O redirection
  to be used. However, the usage is slightly different than for Bash. To check
  what's legal, see the documentation for the 
  <a href="http://www.tcl.tk/man/tcl8.5/TclCmd/exec.htm#M2">Tcl exec</a>
  command and the 
  <a href="http://www.tcl.tk/man/tcl8.5/tutorial/Tcl26.html">tutorial</a>. 
  The major differences are:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>You can't do <tt>2&gt;&amp;1</tt>. That will cause Tcl to write to a
    file named <tt>&amp;1</tt>. Usually this is done to get stderr to go through
    a pipe. You can do that in tcl with <tt>|&amp;</tt> so replace this idiom:
    <tt>... 2&gt;&amp;1 | grep</tt> with <tt>... |&amp; grep</tt></li>
    <li>You can only redirect to a file, not to another descriptor and not from
    a here document.</li>
    <li>tcl supports redirecting to open files with the @ syntax but you
    shouldn't use that here.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>There are some quoting rules that you must pay attention to when writing
  your RUN lines. In general nothing needs to be quoted. Tcl won't strip off any
  ' or " so they will get passed to the invoked program. For example:</p>

<div class="doc_code">
<pre>
... | grep 'find this string'
</pre>
</div>

  <p>This will fail because the ' characters are passed to grep. This would
  instruction grep to look for <tt>'find</tt> in the files <tt>this</tt> and
  <tt>string'</tt>. To avoid this use curly braces to tell Tcl that it should
  treat everything enclosed as one value. So our example would become:</p>

<div class="doc_code">
<pre>
... | grep {find this string}
</pre>
</div>

  <p>Additionally, the characters <tt>[</tt> and <tt>]</tt> are treated 
  specially by Tcl. They tell Tcl to interpret the content as a command to
  execute. Since these characters are often used in regular expressions this can
  have disastrous results and cause the entire test run in a directory to fail.
  For example, a common idiom is to look for some basicblock number:</p>

<div class="doc_code">
<pre>
... | grep bb[2-8]
</pre>
</div>

  <p>This, however, will cause Tcl to fail because its going to try to execute
  a program named "2-8". Instead, what you want is this:</p>

<div class="doc_code">
<pre>
... | grep {bb\[2-8\]}
</pre>
</div>

  <p>Finally, if you need to pass the <tt>\</tt> character down to a program,
  then it must be doubled. This is another Tcl special character. So, suppose
  you had:

<div class="doc_code">
<pre>
... | grep 'i32\*'
</pre>
</div>

  <p>This will fail to match what you want (a pointer to i32). First, the
  <tt>'</tt> do not get stripped off. Second, the <tt>\</tt> gets stripped off
  by Tcl so what grep sees is: <tt>'i32*'</tt>. That's not likely to match
  anything. To resolve this you must use <tt>\\</tt> and the <tt>{}</tt>, like
  this:</p>

<div class="doc_code">
<pre>
... | grep {i32\\*}
</pre>
</div>

</div>

<!-- _______________________________________________________________________ -->
<div class="doc_subsection"><a name="dgvars">Vars And Substitutions</a></div>
<div class="doc_text">
  <p>With a RUN line there are a number of substitutions that are permitted. In
  general, any Tcl variable that is available in the <tt>substitute</tt> 
  function (in <tt>test/lib/llvm.exp</tt>) can be substituted into a RUN line.
  To make a substitution just write the variable's name preceded by a $. 
  Additionally, for compatibility reasons with previous versions of the test
  library, certain names can be accessed with an alternate syntax: a % prefix.
  These alternates are deprecated and may go away in a future version.
  </p>
  <p>Here are the available variable names. The alternate syntax is listed in
  parentheses.</p>

  <dl style="margin-left: 25px">

    <dt><b>path</b><dt>
    <dd>The path to the directory that contains the test case source.  This is 
    for locating any supporting files that are not generated by the test, but 
    used by the test.</dd>

    <dt><b>tmp</b></dt>
    <dd>The path to a temporary file name that could be used for this test case.
    The file name won't conflict with other test cases. You can append to it if

    the prcontext script is located. Note that this script is similar to

    <dd>The suffix for the host platforms share library (dll) files. This

  </dl>
  <p>To add more variables, two things need to be changed. First, add a line in
  the <tt>test/Makefile</tt> that creates the <tt>site.exp</tt> file. This will
  "set" the variable as a global in the site.exp file. Second, in the
  <tt>test/lib/llvm.exp</tt> file, in the substitute proc, add the variable name
  to the list of "global" declarations at the beginning of the proc. That's it,
  the variable can then be used in test scripts.</p>
</div>
  
<!-- _______________________________________________________________________ -->
<div class="doc_subsection"><a name="dgfeatures">Other Features</a></div>
<div class="doc_text">
  <p>To make RUN line writing easier, there are several shell scripts located
  in the <tt>llvm/test/Scripts</tt> directory. For example:</p>
  <dl>
    <dt><b>ignore</b></dt>
    <dd>This script runs its arguments and then always returns 0. This is useful
    in cases where the test needs to cause a tool to generate an error (e.g. to
    check the error output). However, any program in a pipeline that returns a
    non-zero result will cause the test to fail. This script overcomes that 
    issue and nicely documents that the test case is purposefully ignoring the
    result code of the tool</dd>

    <dt><b>not</b></dt>
    <dd>This script runs its arguments and then inverts the result code from 
    it. Zero result codes become 1. Non-zero result codes become 0. This is
    useful to invert the result of a grep. For example "not grep X" means
    succeed only if you don't find X in the input.</dd>
  </dl>

  <p>Sometimes it is necessary to mark a test case as "expected fail" or XFAIL.
  You can easily mark a test as XFAIL just by including  <tt>XFAIL: </tt> on a
  line near the top of the file. This signals that the test case should succeed
  if the test fails. Such test cases are counted separately by DejaGnu. To
  specify an expected fail, use the XFAIL keyword in the comments of the test
  program followed by a colon and one or more regular expressions (separated by
  a comma). The regular expressions allow you to XFAIL the test conditionally
  by host platform. The regular expressions following the : are matched against
  the target triplet or llvmgcc version number for the host machine. If there is
  a match, the test is expected to fail. If not, the test is expected to
  succeed. To XFAIL everywhere just specify <tt>XFAIL: *</tt>. When matching
  the llvm-gcc version, you can specify the major (e.g. 3) or full version 
  (i.e. 3.4) number. Here is an example of an <tt>XFAIL</tt> line:</p>

<div class="doc_code">
<pre>
; XFAIL: darwin,sun,llvmgcc4
</pre>
</div>

  <p>To make the output more useful, the <tt>llvm_runtest</tt> function wil
  scan the lines of the test case for ones that contain a pattern that matches
  PR[0-9]+. This is the syntax for specifying a PR (Problem Report) number that
  is related to the test case. The numer after "PR" specifies the LLVM bugzilla
  number. When a PR number is specified, it will be used in the pass/fail
  reporting. This is useful to quickly get some context when a test fails.</p>

  <p>Finally, any line that contains "END." will cause the special
  interpretation of lines to terminate. This is generally done right after the
  last RUN: line. This has two side effects: (a) it prevents special
  interpretation of lines that are part of the test program, not the
  instructions to the test case, and (b) it speeds things up for really big test
  cases by avoiding interpretation of the remainder of the file.</p>

Structure</a></div>
<!--=========================================================================-->

<div class="doc_text">

<p>As mentioned previously, the <tt>llvm-test</tt> module  provides three types
of tests: MultiSource, SingleSource, and External.  Each tree is then subdivided
into several categories, including applications, benchmarks, regression tests,
code that is strange grammatically, etc.  These organizations should be
relatively self explanatory.</p>

<p>In addition to the regular "whole program"  tests, the <tt>llvm-test</tt>
module also provides a mechanism for compiling the programs in different ways.
If the variable TEST is defined on the gmake command line, the test system will
include a Makefile named <tt>TEST.&lt;value of TEST variable&gt;.Makefile</tt>.
This Makefile can modify build rules to yield different results.</p>

<p>For example, the LLVM nightly tester uses <tt>TEST.nightly.Makefile</tt> to
create the nightly test reports.  To run the nightly tests, run <tt>gmake
TEST=nightly</tt>.</p>

<p>There are several TEST Makefiles available in the tree.  Some of them are
designed for internal LLVM research and will not work outside of the LLVM
research group.  They may still be valuable, however, as a guide to writing your
own TEST Makefile for any optimization or analysis passes that you develop with
LLVM.</p>

<p>Note, when configuring the <tt>llvm-test</tt> module, you might want to
specify the following configuration options:</p>
<dl>
  <dt><i>--enable-spec2000</i>
  <dt><i>--enable-spec2000=&lt;<tt>directory</tt>&gt;</i>
  <dd>
    Enable the use of SPEC2000 when testing LLVM.  This is disabled by default
    (unless <tt>configure</tt> finds SPEC2000 installed).  By specifying
    <tt>directory</tt>, you can tell configure where to find the SPEC2000
    benchmarks.  If <tt>directory</tt> is left unspecified, <tt>configure</tt>
    uses the default value
    <tt>/home/vadve/shared/benchmarks/speccpu2000/benchspec</tt>.
    <p>

  <dt><i>--enable-spec95</i>
  <dt><i>--enable-spec95=&lt;<tt>directory</tt>&gt;</i>
  <dd>
    Enable the use of SPEC95 when testing LLVM.  It is similar to the
    <i>--enable-spec2000</i> option.
    <p>

  <dt><i>--enable-povray</i>
  <dt><i>--enable-povray=&lt;<tt>directory</tt>&gt;</i>
  <dd>
    Enable the use of Povray as an external test.  Versions of Povray written
    in C should work.  This option is similar to the <i>--enable-spec2000</i>
    option.

<div class="doc_text">

<p>First, all tests are executed within the LLVM object directory tree.  They
<i>are not</i> executed inside of the LLVM source tree. This is because the
test suite creates temporary files during execution.</p>

<p>The master Makefile in <tt>llvm/test</tt> is capable of running only the
DejaGNU driven tests. By default, it will run all of these tests.</p>

<p>To run only the DejaGNU driven tests, run <tt>gmake</tt> at the
command line in <tt>llvm/test</tt>.  To run a specific directory of tests, use
the <tt>TESTSUITE</tt> variable.
</p>

<p>For example, to run the Regression tests, type 
<tt>gmake TESTSUITE=Regression</tt> in <tt>llvm/tests</tt>.</p>

<p>Note that there are no Makefiles in <tt>llvm/test/Features</tt> and
<tt>llvm/test/Regression</tt>. You must use DejaGNU from the <tt>llvm/test</tt>
directory to run them.</p>

<p>To run the <tt>llvm-test</tt> suite, you need to use the following steps:</p>

<ol>
  <li><tt>cd</tt> into the <tt>llvm/projects</tt> directory</li>

  <li><p>Check out the <tt>test-suite</tt> module with:</p>

<div class="doc_code">
<pre>
% svn co http://llvm.org/svn/llvm-project/test-suite/trunk llvm-test
</pre>
</div>

      <p>This will get the test suite into <tt>llvm/projects/llvm-test</tt></p>

  <li><p>Configure the test suite using llvm configure. This will automatically configure llvm-test. 
         You must do it from the top level otherwise llvm-gcc will not be set which is required to 
        run llvm-test:</p>
<div class="doc_code">
<pre>
% cd $LLVM_OBJ_ROOT ; $LLVM_SRC_ROOT/configure --with-llvmgccdir=$LLVM_GCC_DIR
</pre>
</div>
    <p>Note that that <tt>$LLVM_GCC_DIR</tt> is the directory where you
    <em>installed</em> llvm-gcc, not its src or obj directory.</p>
  </li>

  <li><p>Change back to the <tt>llvm/projects/llvm-test</tt> directory you created before
  and run <tt>gmake</tt> (or just "<tt>make</tt>" on systems where GNU make is
  the default, such as linux.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Note that the second and third steps only need to be done once. After you
have the suite checked out and configured, you don't need to do it again (unless
the test code or configure script changes).</p>

<p>To make a specialized test (use one of the
<tt>llvm-test/TEST.&lt;type&gt;.Makefile</tt>s), just run:</p>

<div class="doc_code">
<pre>
% cd llvm/projects/llvm-test
% gmake TEST=&lt;type&gt; test
</pre>
</div>

<p>For example, you could run the nightly tester tests using the following
commands:</p>

<div class="doc_code">
<pre>
% cd llvm/projects/llvm-test
% gmake TEST=nightly test
</pre>
</div>

<p>Regardless of which test you're running, the results are printed on standard
output and standard error.  You can redirect these results to a file if you
choose.</p>

<p>Some tests are known to fail.  Some are bugs that we have not fixed yet;
others are features that we haven't added yet (or may never add).  In DejaGNU,
the result for such tests will be XFAIL (eXpected FAILure).  In this way, you
can tell the difference between an expected and unexpected failure.</p>

<p>The tests in <tt>llvm-test</tt> have no such feature at this time. If the
test passes, only warnings and other miscellaneous output will be generated.  If
a test fails, a large &lt;program&gt; FAILED message will be displayed.  This
will help you separate benign warnings from actual test failures.</p>

<!-- _______________________________________________________________________ -->

<div class="doc_text">

<p>Assuming you can run llvm-test, (e.g. "<tt>gmake TEST=nightly report</tt>"
should work), it is really easy to run optimizations or code generator
components against every program in the tree, collecting statistics or running
custom checks for correctness.  At base, this is how the nightly tester works,
it's just one example of a general framework.</p>

<p>Lets say that you have an LLVM optimization pass, and you want to see how
many times it triggers.  First thing you should do is add an LLVM
<a href="ProgrammersManual.html#Statistic">statistic</a> to your pass, which
will tally counts of things you care about.</p>

<p>Following this, you can set up a test and a report that collects these and
formats them for easy viewing.  This consists of two files, an
"<tt>llvm-test/TEST.XXX.Makefile</tt>" fragment (where XXX is the name of your
test) and an "<tt>llvm-test/TEST.XXX.report</tt>" file that indicates how to
format the output into a table.  There are many example reports of various
levels of sophistication included with llvm-test, and the framework is very
general.</p>

<p>If you are interested in testing an optimization pass, check out the
"libcalls" test as an example.  It can be run like this:<p>

<div class="doc_code">
<pre>
% cd llvm/projects/llvm-test/MultiSource/Benchmarks  # or some other level
% make TEST=libcalls report
</pre>
</div>

<p>This will do a bunch of stuff, then eventually print a table like this:</p>

<div class="doc_code">
<pre>
Name                                  | total | #exit |
...
FreeBench/analyzer/analyzer           | 51    | 6     | 
FreeBench/fourinarow/fourinarow       | 1     | 1     | 
FreeBench/neural/neural               | 19    | 9     | 
FreeBench/pifft/pifft                 | 5     | 3     | 
MallocBench/cfrac/cfrac               | 1     | *     | 
MallocBench/espresso/espresso         | 52    | 12    | 
MallocBench/gs/gs                     | 4     | *     | 
Prolangs-C/TimberWolfMC/timberwolfmc  | 302   | *     | 
Prolangs-C/agrep/agrep                | 33    | 12    | 
Prolangs-C/allroots/allroots          | *     | *     | 
Prolangs-C/assembler/assembler        | 47    | *     | 
Prolangs-C/bison/mybison              | 74    | *     | 
...
</pre>
</div>

<p>This basically is grepping the -stats output and displaying it in a table.
You can also use the "TEST=libcalls report.html" target to get the table in HTML
form, similarly for report.csv and report.tex.</p>

<p>The source for this is in llvm-test/TEST.libcalls.*.  The format is pretty
simple: the Makefile indicates how to run the test (in this case, 
"<tt>opt -simplify-libcalls -stats</tt>"), and the report contains one line for
each column of the output.  The first value is the header for the column and the
second is the regex to grep the output of the command for.  There are lots of
example reports that can do fancy stuff.</p>

<div class="doc_text">

<p>
The <a href="http://llvm.org/nightlytest/">LLVM Nightly Testers</a>
automatically check out an LLVM tree, build it, run the "nightly" 
program test (described above), run all of the feature and regression tests, 
delete the checked out tree, and then submit the results to 
<a href="http://llvm.org/nightlytest/">http://llvm.org/nightlytest/</a>. 
After test results are submitted to 
<a href="http://llvm.org/nightlytest/">http://llvm.org/nightlytest/</a>,
they are processed and displayed on the tests page. An email to 
<a href="http://lists.cs.uiuc.edu/pipermail/llvm-testresults/">
llvm-testresults@cs.uiuc.edu</a> summarizing the results is also generated. 
This testing scheme is designed to ensure that programs don't break as well 
as keep track of LLVM's progress over time.</p>

<p>If you'd like to set up an instance of the nightly tester to run on your 
machine, take a look at the comments at the top of the 
<tt>utils/NewNightlyTest.pl</tt> file. If you decide to set up a nightly tester 
please choose a unique nickname and invoke <tt>utils/NewNightlyTest.pl</tt> 
with the "-nickname [yournickname]" command line option. 

<p>You can create a shell script to encapsulate the running of the script.
The optimized x86 Linux nightly test is run from just such a script:</p>

<div class="doc_code">
<pre>
#!/bin/bash
BASE=/proj/work/llvm/nightlytest
export BUILDDIR=$BASE/build 
export WEBDIR=$BASE/testresults 
export LLVMGCCDIR=/proj/work/llvm/cfrontend/install
export PATH=/proj/install/bin:$LLVMGCCDIR/bin:$PATH
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/proj/install/lib
cd $BASE
cp /proj/work/llvm/llvm/utils/NewNightlyTest.pl .
nice ./NewNightlyTest.pl -nice -release -verbose -parallel -enable-linscan \
   -nickname NightlyTester -noexternals &gt; output.log 2&gt;&amp;1 
</pre>
</div>

<p>It is also possible to specify the the location your nightly test results
are submitted. You can do this by passing the command line option
"-submit-server [server_address]" and "-submit-script [script_on_server]" to
<tt>utils/NewNightlyTest.pl</tt>. For example, to submit to the llvm.org 
nightly test results page, you would invoke the nightly test script with 
"-submit-server llvm.org -submit-script /nightlytest/NightlyTestAccept.cgi". 
If these options are not specified, the nightly test script sends the results 
to the llvm.org nightly test results page.</p>

<p>Take a look at the <tt>NewNightlyTest.pl</tt> file to see what all of the
flags and strings do.  If you start running the nightly tests, please let us
know. Thanks!</p>
