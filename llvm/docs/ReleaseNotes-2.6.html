<div class="doc_text">
<p>
The LLVM 2.6 distribution currently consists of code from the core LLVM
repository &mdash;which roughly includes the LLVM optimizers, code generators
and supporting tools &mdash; and the llvm-gcc repository.  In addition to this
code, the LLVM Project includes other sub-projects that are in development.  The
two which are the most actively developed are the <a href="#clang">Clang
Project</a> and the <a href="#vmkit">VMKit Project</a>.
</p>

</div>


<!--=========================================================================-->
<div class="doc_subsection">
<a name="clang">Clang: C/C++/Objective-C Frontend Toolkit</a>
</div>

<div class="doc_text">

<p>The <a href="http://clang.llvm.org/">Clang project</a> is an effort to build
a set of new 'LLVM native' front-end technologies for the LLVM optimizer and
code generator.  While Clang is not included in the LLVM 2.6 release, it is
continuing to make major strides forward in all areas.  Its C and Objective-C
parsing and code generation support is now very solid.  For example, it is
capable of successfully building many real-world applications for X86-32
and X86-64,
including the <a href="http://wiki.freebsd.org/BuildingFreeBSDWithClang">FreeBSD
kernel</a> and <a href="http://gcc.gnu.org/gcc-4.2/">gcc 4.2</a>.  C++ is also
making <a href="http://clang.llvm.org/cxx_status.html">incredible progress</a>,
and work on templates has recently started.  If you are
interested in fast compiles and good diagnostics, we encourage you to try it out
by <a href="http://clang.llvm.org/get_started.html">building from mainline</a>
and reporting any issues you hit to the <a
href="http://lists.cs.uiuc.edu/mailman/listinfo/cfe-dev">Clang front-end mailing
list</a>.</p>

<p>In the LLVM 2.6 time-frame, the Clang team has made many improvements:</p>

<ul>
<li>Something wonderful!</li>
<li>AuroraUX / FreeBSD &amp; OpenBSD Toolchain support.</li>
<li>Many many bugs are fixed and many features have been added.</li>
</ul>
</div>

<!--=========================================================================-->
<div class="doc_subsection">
<a name="clangsa">Clang Static Analyzer</a>
</div>

<div class="doc_text">

<p>Previously announced in the 2.4 LLVM release, the Clang project also
includes an early stage static source code analysis tool for <a
href="http://clang.llvm.org/StaticAnalysis.html">automatically finding bugs</a>
in C and Objective-C programs. The tool performs a growing set of checks to find
bugs that occur on a specific path within a program.</p>

<p>In the LLVM 2.6 time-frame there have been many significant improvements to
XYZ.</p>

<p>The set of checks performed by the static analyzer continues to expand, and
future plans for the tool include full source-level inter-procedural analysis
and deeper checks such as buffer overrun detection. There are many opportunities
to extend and enhance the static analyzer, and anyone interested in working on
this project is encouraged to get involved!</p>

The <a href="http://vmkit.llvm.org/">VMKit project</a> is an implementation of
a JVM and a CLI Virtual Machines (Microsoft .NET is an
implementation of the CLI) using the Just-In-Time compiler of LLVM.</p>

<p>Following LLVM 2.6, VMKit has its XYZ release that you can find on its

<div class="doc_text">

<p>
<a href="http://macruby.org">MacRuby</a> is an implementation of Ruby on top of
core Mac OS X technologies, such as the Objective-C common runtime and garbage
collector, and the CoreFoundation framework. It is principally developed by
Apple and aims at enabling the creation of full-fledged Mac OS X applications.
</p>

<p>
MacRuby uses LLVM for optimization passes, JIT and AOT compilation of Ruby
expressions. It also uses zero-cost DWARF exceptions to implement Ruby exception
handling.</p>

<a name="pure">Pure</a>
</div>

<div class="doc_text">
<p>
<a href="http://pure-lang.googlecode.com/">Pure</a>
is an algebraic/functional programming language based on term rewriting.
Programs are collections of equations which are used to evaluate expressions in
a symbolic fashion. Pure offers dynamic typing, eager and lazy evaluation,
lexical closures, a hygienic macro system (also based on term rewriting),
built-in list and matrix support (including list and matrix comprehensions) and
an easy-to-use C interface. The interpreter uses LLVM as a backend to
 JIT-compile Pure programs to fast native code.</p>

<p>In addition to the usual algebraic data structures, Pure also has
MATLAB-style matrices in order to support numeric computations and signal
processing in an efficient way. Pure is mainly aimed at mathematical
applications right now, but it has been designed as a general purpose language.
The dynamic interpreter environment and the C interface make it possible to use
it as a kind of functional scripting language for many application areas.

<p>
<a href="http://www.dsource.org/projects/ldc">LDC</a> is an implementation of
the D Programming Language using the LLVM optimizer and code generator.
The LDC project works great with the LLVM 2.6 release.  General improvements in
this
cycle have included new inline asm constraint handling, better debug info
support, general bugfixes, and better x86-64 support.  This has allowed
some major improvements in LDC, getting us much closer to being as
fully featured as the original DMD compiler from DigitalMars.

<a name="changes">Major Changes and Removed Features</a>
</div>

<div class="doc_text">

<p>If you're already an LLVM user or developer with out-of-tree changes based
on LLVM 2.5, this section lists some "gotchas" that you may run into upgrading
from the previous release.</p>

<ul>

<li>Something horrible!</li>

</ul>


<p>In addition, many APIs have changed in this release.  Some of the major LLVM
API changes are:</p>

<ul>
<li>LLVM's global uniquing tables for <tt>Type</tt>s and <tt>Constant</tt>s have
    been privatized into members of an <tt>LLVMContext</tt>.  A number of APIs
    now take an <tt>LLVMContext</tt> as a parameter.  To smooth the transition
    for clients that will only ever use a single context, the new 
    <tt>getGlobalContext()</tt> API can be used to access a default global 
    context which can be passed in any and all cases where a context is 
    required.
<li>The <tt>getABITypeSize</tt> methods are now called <tt>getAllocSize</tt>.</li>
<li>The <tt>Add</tt>, <tt>Sub</tt>, and <tt>Mul</tt> operators are no longer
    overloaded for floating-point types. Floating-point addition, subtraction,
    and multiplication are now represented with new operators <tt>FAdd</tt>,
    <tt>FSub</tt>, and <tt>FMul</tt>. In the <tt>IRBuilder</tt> API,
    <tt>CreateAdd</tt>, <tt>CreateSub</tt>, <tt>CreateMul</tt>, and
    <tt>CreateNeg</tt> should only be used for integer arithmetic now;
    <tt>CreateFAdd</tt>, <tt>CreateFSub</tt>, <tt>CreateFMul</tt>, and
    <tt>CreateFNeg</tt> should now be used for floating-point arithmetic.</li>
<li>The DynamicLibrary class can no longer be constructed, its functionality has
    moved to static member functions.</li>
<li><tt>raw_fd_ostream</tt>'s constructor for opening a given filename now
    takes an extra <tt>Force</tt> argument. If <tt>Force</tt> is set to
    <tt>false</tt>, an error will be reported if a file with the given name
    already exists. If <tt>Force</tt> is set to <tt>true</tt>, the file will
    be silently truncated (which is the behavior before this flag was
    added).</li>
<li><tt>SCEVHandle</tt> no longer exists, because reference counting is no
longer done for <tt>SCEV*</tt> objects, instead <tt>const SCEV*</tt> should be
used.</li>

<li>Many APIs, notably <tt>llvm::Value</tt>, now use the <tt>StringRef</tt>
and <tt>Twine</tt> classes instead of passing <tt>const char*</tt>
or <tt>std::string</tt>, as described in
the <a href="ProgrammersManual.html#string_apis">Programmer's Manual</a>. Most
clients should be unaffected by this transition, unless they are used to <tt>Value::getName()</tt> returning a string. Here are some tips on updating to 2.6:
  <ul>
    <li><tt>getNameStr()</tt> is still available, and matches the old
      behavior. Replacing <tt>getName()</tt> calls with this is an safe option,
      although more efficient alternatives are now possible.</li>

    <li>If you were just relying on <tt>getName()</tt> being able to be sent to
      a <tt>std::ostream</tt>, consider migrating
      to <tt>llvm::raw_ostream</tt>.</li>
      
    <li>If you were using <tt>getName().c_str()</tt> to get a <tt>const
        char*</tt> pointer to the name, you can use <tt>getName().data()</tt>.
        Note that this string (as before), may not be the entire name if the
        name containts embedded null characters.</li>

    <li>If you were using operator plus on the result of <tt>getName()</tt> and
      treating the result as an <tt>std::string</tt>, you can either
      uses <tt>Twine::str</tt> to get the result as an <tt>std::string</tt>, or
      could move to a <tt>Twine</tt> based design.</li>

    <li><tt>isName()</tt> should be replaced with comparison
      against <tt>getName()</tt> (this is now efficient).
  </ul>
</li>

<li>The registration interfaces for backend Targets has changed (what was
previously TargetMachineRegistry). For backend authors, see the <a href="WritingAnLLVMBackend.html#TargetRegistration">Writing An LLVM Backend</a> guide. For clients, the notable API changes are:
  <ul>
    <li><tt>TargetMachineRegistry</tt> has been renamed
      to <tt>TargetRegistry</tt>.</li>

    <li>Clients should move to using the <tt>TargetRegistry::lookupTarget()</tt>
      function to find targets.</li>
  </ul>
</li>

<li>llvm-dis now fails if output file exists, instead of dumping to stdout.
FIXME: describe any other tool changes due to the raw_fd_ostream change.  FIXME:
This is not an API change, maybe there should be a tool changes section?</li>
<li>temporarely due to Context API change passes should call doInitialization()
method of the pass they inherit from, otherwise Context is NULL.
FIXME: remove this entry when this is no longer needed.<li>
</ul>

<div class="doc_text">

<p>LLVM is known to work on the following platforms:</p>

<ul>
<li>Intel and AMD machines (IA32, X86-64, AMD64, EMT-64) running Red Hat
Linux, Fedora Core, FreeBSD and AuroraUX (and probably other unix-like systems).</li>
<li>PowerPC and X86-based Mac OS X systems, running 10.3 and above in 32-bit

<div class="doc_text">

<p>llvm-gcc does not currently support <a href="http://llvm.org/PR869">Link-Time
Optimization</a> on most platforms "out-of-the-box".  Please inquire on the
LLVMdev mailing list if you are interested.</p>

<p>The only major language feature of GCC not supported by llvm-gcc is
    the <tt>__builtin_apply</tt> family of builtins.   However, some extensions
    are only supported on some targets.  For example, trampolines are only
    supported on some targets (these are used when you take the address of a
    nested function).</p>

<p>If you run into GCC extensions which are not supported, please let us know.

  <a name="ada-fe">Known problems with the llvm-gcc Ada front-end</a>
</div>

<div class="doc_text">
The llvm-gcc 4.2 Ada compiler works fairly well; however, this is not a mature
technology, and problems should be expected.
<ul>
<li>The Ada front-end currently only builds on X86-32.  This is mainly due
to lack of trampoline support (pointers to nested functions) on other platforms.
However, it <a href="http://llvm.org/PR2006">also fails to build on X86-64</a>
which does support trampolines.</li>
<li>The Ada front-end <a href="http://llvm.org/PR2007">fails to bootstrap</a>.
This is due to lack of LLVM support for <tt>setjmp</tt>/<tt>longjmp</tt> style
exception handling, which is used internally by the compiler.
Workaround: configure with --disable-bootstrap.</li>
<li>The c380004, <a href="http://llvm.org/PR2010">c393010</a>
and <a href="http://llvm.org/PR2421">cxg2021</a> ACATS tests fail
(c380004 also fails with gcc-4.2 mainline).
If the compiler is built with checks disabled then <a href="http://llvm.org/PR2010">c393010</a>
causes the compiler to go into an infinite loop, using up all system memory.</li>
<li>Some GCC specific Ada tests continue to crash the compiler.</li>
<li>The -E binder option (exception backtraces)
<a href="http://llvm.org/PR1982">does not work</a> and will result in programs
crashing if an exception is raised.  Workaround: do not use -E.</li>
<li>Only discrete types <a href="http://llvm.org/PR1981">are allowed to start
or finish at a non-byte offset</a> in a record.  Workaround: do not pack records
or use representation clauses that result in a field of a non-discrete type
starting or finishing in the middle of a byte.</li>
<li>The <tt>lli</tt> interpreter <a href="http://llvm.org/PR2009">considers
'main' as generated by the Ada binder to be invalid</a>.
Workaround: hand edit the file to use pointers for <tt>argv</tt> and
<tt>envp</tt> rather than integers.</li>
<li>The <tt>-fstack-check</tt> option <a href="http://llvm.org/PR2008">is
ignored</a>.</li>

<p>The Llvm.Linkage module is broken, and has incorrect values. Only
Llvm.Linkage.External, Llvm.Linkage.Available_externally, and
Llvm.Linkage.Link_once will be correct. If you need any of the other linkage
modes, you'll have to write an external C library in order to expose the
functionality. This has been fixed in the trunk.</p>
