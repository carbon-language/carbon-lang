<p>
The LLVM 2.6 distribution currently consists of code from the core LLVM
repository (which roughly includes the LLVM optimizers, code generators
and supporting tools), the Clang repository and the llvm-gcc repository.  In
addition to this code, the LLVM Project includes other sub-projects that are in
development.  Here we include updates on these subprojects.

<div class="doc_subsection">
<a name="clang">Clang: C/C++/Objective-C Frontend Toolkit</a>
</div>

<div class="doc_text">

<p>The <a href="http://clang.llvm.org/">Clang project</a> is an effort to build
a set of new 'LLVM native' front-end technologies for the C family of languages.
LLVM 2.6 is the first release to officially include Clang, and it provides a
production quality C and Objective-C compiler.  If you are interested in <a 
href="http://clang.llvm.org/performance.html">fast compiles</a> and
<a href="http://clang.llvm.org/diagnostics.html">good diagnostics</a>, we
encourage you to try it out.  Clang currently compiles typical Objective-C code
3x faster than GCC and compiles C code about 30% faster than GCC at -O0 -g
(which is when the most pressure is on the frontend).</p>

<p>In addition to supporting these languages, C++ support is also <a
href="http://clang.llvm.org/cxx_status.html">well under way</a>, and mainline
Clang is able to parse the libstdc++ 4.2 headers and even codegen simple apps.
If you are interested in Clang C++ support or any other Clang feature, we
strongly encourage you to get involved on the <a 
href="http://lists.cs.uiuc.edu/mailman/listinfo/cfe-dev">Clang front-end mailing
list</a>.</p>

<p>In the LLVM 2.6 time-frame, the Clang team has made many improvements:</p>

<ul>
<li>C and Objective-C support are now considered production quality.</li>
<li>AuroraUX, FreeBSD and OpenBSD are now supported.</li>
<li>Most of Objective-C 2.0 is now supported with the GNU runtime.</li>
<li>Many many bugs are fixed and lots of features have been added.</li>
</ul>
</div>

<!--=========================================================================-->
<div class="doc_subsection">
<a name="clangsa">Clang Static Analyzer</a>
</div>

<div class="doc_text">

<p>Previously announced in the 2.4 and 2.5 LLVM releases, the Clang project also
includes an early stage static source code analysis tool for <a
href="http://clang.llvm.org/StaticAnalysis.html">automatically finding bugs</a>
in C and Objective-C programs. The tool performs checks to find
bugs that occur on a specific path within a program.</p>

<p>In the LLVM 2.6 time-frame, the analyzer core has undergone several important
improvements and cleanups and now includes a new <em>Checker</em> interface that
is intended to eventually serve as a basis for domain-specific checks. Further,
in addition to generating HTML files for reporting analysis results, the
analyzer can now also emit bug reports in a structured XML format that is
intended to be easily readable by other programs.</p>

<p>The set of checks performed by the static analyzer continues to expand, and
future plans for the tool include full source-level inter-procedural analysis
and deeper checks such as buffer overrun detection. There are many opportunities
to extend and enhance the static analyzer, and anyone interested in working on
this project is encouraged to get involved!</p>

<a name="vmkit">VMKit: JVM/CLI Virtual Machine Implementation</a>
</div>

<div class="doc_text">
<p>
The <a href="http://vmkit.llvm.org/">VMKit project</a> is an implementation of
a JVM and a CLI Virtual Machine (Microsoft .NET is an
implementation of the CLI) using LLVM for static and just-in-time
compilation.</p>

<p>
VMKit version 0.26 builds with LLVM 2.6 and you can find it on its
<a href="http://vmkit.llvm.org/releases/">web page</a>. The release includes
bug fixes, cleanup and new features. The major changes are:</p>

<ul>

<li>A new llcj tool to generate shared libraries or executables of Java
    files.</li>
<li>Cooperative garbage collection. </li>
<li>Fast subtype checking (paper from Click et al [JGI'02]). </li>
<li>Implementation of a two-word header for Java objects instead of the original
    three-word header. </li>
<li>Better Java specification-compliance: division by zero checks, stack
    overflow checks, finalization and references support. </li>

</ul>

<div class="doc_subsection">
<a name="compiler-rt">compiler-rt: Compiler Runtime Library</a>
</div>

<div class="doc_text">
<p>
The new LLVM <a href="http://compiler-rt.llvm.org/">compiler-rt project</a>
is a simple library that provides an implementation of the low-level
target-specific hooks required by code generation and other runtime components.
For example, when compiling for a 32-bit target, converting a double to a 64-bit
unsigned integer is compiled into a runtime call to the "__fixunsdfdi"
function. The compiler-rt library provides highly optimized implementations of
this and other low-level routines (some are 3x faster than the equivalent
libgcc routines).</p>

<p>
All of the code in the compiler-rt project is available under the standard LLVM
License, a "BSD-style" license.</p>

</div>

<div class="doc_text">
<p>
The new LLVM <a href="http://klee.llvm.org/">KLEE project</a> is a symbolic
execution framework for programs in LLVM bitcode form.  KLEE tries to
symbolically evaluate "all" paths through the application and records state
transitions that lead to fault states.  This allows it to construct testcases
that lead to faults and can even be used to verify algorithms.  For more
details, please see the <a

<a name="dragonegg">DragonEgg: GCC-4.5 as an LLVM frontend</a>
</div>

<div class="doc_text">
<p>
The goal of <a href="http://dragonegg.llvm.org/">DragonEgg</a> is to make
gcc-4.5 act like llvm-gcc without requiring any gcc modifications whatsoever.
<a href="http://dragonegg.llvm.org/">DragonEgg</a> is a shared library (llvm.so)
that is loaded by gcc at runtime.  It uses the new gcc plugin architecture to
disable the GCC optimizers and code generators, and schedule the LLVM optimizers
and code generators (or direct output of LLVM IR) instead.  Currently only Linux
and Darwin are supported, and only on x86-32 and x86-64.  It should be easy to
add additional unix-like architectures and other processor families.  In theory
it should be possible to use <a href="http://dragonegg.llvm.org/">DragonEgg</a>
with any language supported by gcc, however only C and Fortran work well for the
moment.  Ada and C++ work to some extent, while Java, Obj-C and Obj-C++ are so
far entirely untested.  Since gcc-4.5 has not yet been released, neither has
<a href="http://dragonegg.llvm.org/">DragonEgg</a>.  To build
<a href="http://dragonegg.llvm.org/">DragonEgg</a> you will need to check out the
development versions of <a href="http://gcc.gnu.org/svn.html/"> gcc</a>,
<a href="http://llvm.org/docs/GettingStarted.html#checkout">llvm</a> and
<a href="http://dragonegg.llvm.org/">DragonEgg</a> from their respective
subversion repositories, and follow the instructions in the
<a href="http://dragonegg.llvm.org/">DragonEgg</a> README.

<div class="doc_subsection">
<a name="mc">llvm-mc: Machine Code Toolkit</a>
</div>

<div class="doc_text">
<p>
The LLVM Machine Code (MC) Toolkit project is a (very early) effort to build
better tools for dealing with machine code, object file formats, etc.  The idea
is to be able to generate most of the target specific details of assemblers and
disassemblers from existing LLVM target .td files (with suitable enhancements),
and to build infrastructure for reading and writing common object file formats.
One of the first deliverables is to build a full assembler and integrate it into
the compiler, which is predicted to substantially reduce compile time in some
scenarios.
</p>

<p>In the LLVM 2.6 timeframe, the MC framework has grown to the point where it
can reliably parse and pretty print (with some encoding information) a
darwin/x86 .s file successfully, and has the very early phases of a Mach-O
assembler in progress.  Beyond the MC framework itself, major refactoring of the
LLVM code generator has started.  The idea is to make the code generator reason
about the code it is producing in a much more semantic way, rather than a
textual way.  For example, the code generator now uses MCSection objects to
represent section assignments, instead of text strings that print to .section
directives.</p>

<p>MC is an early and ongoing project that will hopefully continue to lead to
many improvements in the code generator and build infrastructure useful for many
other situations.

<p><a href="http://github.com/evanphx/rubinius">Rubinius</a> is an environment
for running Ruby code which strives to write as much of the core class
implementation in Ruby as possible. Combined with a bytecode interpreting VM, it
uses LLVM to optimize and compile ruby code down to machine code. Techniques
such as type feedback, method inlining, and uncommon traps are all used to
remove dynamism from ruby execution and increase performance.</p>

<p>Since LLVM 2.5, Rubinius has made several major leaps forward, implementing
a counter based JIT, type feedback and speculative method inlining.

<a href="http://pure-lang.googlecode.com/">Pure</a>
is an algebraic/functional programming language based on term rewriting.
Programs are collections of equations which are used to evaluate expressions in
a symbolic fashion. Pure offers dynamic typing, eager and lazy evaluation,
lexical closures, a hygienic macro system (also based on term rewriting),
built-in list and matrix support (including list and matrix comprehensions) and
an easy-to-use C interface. The interpreter uses LLVM as a backend to
 JIT-compile Pure programs to fast native code.</p>

<p>Pure versions 0.31 and later have been tested and are known to work with
LLVM 2.6 (and continue to work with older LLVM releases >= 2.3 as well).

<p>This release includes a huge number of bug fixes, performance tweaks and
minor improvements.  Some of the major improvements and new features are listed
in this section.

<!--=========================================================================-->
<div class="doc_subsection">
<a name="majorfeatures">Major New Features</a>
</div>

<div class="doc_text">

<p>LLVM 2.6 includes several major new capabilities:</p>

<ul>
<li>New <a href="#compiler-rt">compiler-rt</a>, <A href="#klee">KLEE</a>
    and <a href="#mc">machine code toolkit</a> sub-projects.</li>
<li>Debug information now includes line numbers when optimizations are enabled.
    This allows statistical sampling tools like OProfile and Shark to map
    samples back to source lines.</li>
<li>LLVM now includes new experimental backends to support the MSP430, SystemZ
    and BlackFin architectures.</li>
<li>LLVM supports a new <a href="GoldPlugin.html">Gold Linker Plugin</a> which
    enables support for <a href="LinkTimeOptimization.html">transparent
    link-time optimization</a> on ELF targets when used with the Gold binutils
    linker.</li>
<li>LLVM now supports doing optimization and code generation on multiple 
    threads.  Please see the <a href="ProgrammersManual.html#threading">LLVM
    Programmer's Manual</a> for more information.</li>
<li>LLVM now has experimental support for <a
    href="http://nondot.org/~sabre/LLVMNotes/EmbeddedMetadata.txt">embedded
    metadata</a> in LLVM IR, though the implementation is not guaranteed to be
    final and the .bc file format may change in future releases.  Debug info 
    does not yet use this format in LLVM 2.6.</li>
</ul>

</div>

<!--=========================================================================-->
<div class="doc_subsection">
<a name="coreimprovements">LLVM IR and Core Improvements</a>
</div>

<div class="doc_text">
<p>LLVM IR has several new features for better support of new targets and that
expose new optimization opportunities:</p>

<ul>
<li>The <a href="LangRef.html#i_add">add</a>, <a 
    href="LangRef.html#i_sub">sub</a> and <a href="LangRef.html#i_mul">mul</a>
    instructions have been split into integer and floating point versions (like
    divide and remainder), introducing new <a
    href="LangRef.html#i_fadd">fadd</a>, <a href="LangRef.html#i_fsub">fsub</a>,
    and <a href="LangRef.html#i_fmul">fmul</a> instructions.</li>
<li>The <a href="LangRef.html#i_add">add</a>, <a 
    href="LangRef.html#i_sub">sub</a> and <a href="LangRef.html#i_mul">mul</a>
    instructions now support optional "nsw" and "nuw" bits which indicate that
    the operation is guaranteed to not overflow (in the signed or
    unsigned case, respectively).  This gives the optimizer more information and
    can be used for things like C signed integer values, which are undefined on
    overflow.</li>
<li>The <a href="LangRef.html#i_sdiv">sdiv</a> instruction now supports an
    optional "exact" flag which indicates that the result of the division is
    guaranteed to have a remainder of zero.  This is useful for optimizing pointer
    subtraction in C.</li>
<li>The <a href="LangRef.html#i_getelementptr">getelementptr</a> instruction now
    supports arbitrary integer index values for array/pointer indices.  This
    allows for better code generation on 16-bit targets like PIC16.</li>
<li>The <a href="LangRef.html#i_getelementptr">getelementptr</a> instruction now
    supports an "inbounds" optimization hint that tells the optimizer that the
    pointer is guaranteed to be within its allocated object.</li>
<li>LLVM now support a series of new linkage types for global values which allow
    for better optimization and new capabilities:
    <ul>
    <li><a href="LangRef.html#linkage_linkonce">linkonce_odr</a> and
        <a href="LangRef.html#linkage_weak">weak_odr</a> have the same linkage
        semantics as the non-"odr" linkage types.  The difference is that these
        linkage types indicate that all definitions of the specified function
        are guaranteed to have the same semantics.  This allows inlining
        templates functions in C++ but not inlining weak functions in C,
        which previously both got the same linkage type.</li>
    <li><a href="LangRef.html#linkage_available_externally">available_externally
        </a> is a new linkage type that gives the optimizer visibility into the
        definition of a function (allowing inlining and side effect analysis)
        but that does not cause code to be generated.  This allows better
        optimization of "GNU inline" functions, extern templates, etc.</li>
    <li><a href="LangRef.html#linkage_linker_private">linker_private</a> is a
        new linkage type (which is only useful on Mac OS X) that is used for
        some metadata generation and other obscure things.</li>
    </ul></li>
<li>Finally, target-specific intrinsics can now return multiple values, which
    is useful for modeling target operations with multiple results.</li>
</ul>

</div>

<!--=========================================================================-->
<div class="doc_subsection">
<a name="optimizer">Optimizer Improvements</a>
</div>

<div class="doc_text">

<p>In addition to a large array of minor performance tweaks and bug fixes, this
release includes a few major enhancements and additions to the optimizers:</p>

<ul>

<li>The <a href="Passes.html#scalarrepl">Scalar Replacement of Aggregates</a>
    pass has many improvements that allow it to better promote vector unions,
    variables which are memset, and much more strange code that can happen to
    do bitfield accesses to register operations.  An interesting change is that
    it now produces "unusual" integer sizes (like i1704) in some cases and lets
    other optimizers clean things up.</li>
<li>The <a href="Passes.html#loop-reduce">Loop Strength Reduction</a> pass now
    promotes small integer induction variables to 64-bit on 64-bit targets,
    which provides a major performance boost for much numerical code.  It also
    promotes shorts to int on 32-bit hosts, etc.  LSR now also analyzes pointer
    expressions (e.g. getelementptrs), as well as integers.</li>
<li>The <a href="Passes.html#gvn">GVN</a> pass now eliminates partial
    redundancies of loads in simple cases.</li>
<li>The <a href="Passes.html#inline">Inliner</a> now reuses stack space when
    inlining similar arrays from multiple callees into one caller.</li>
<li>LLVM includes a new experimental Static Single Information (SSI)
    construction pass.</li>
</li>

</ul>

</div>


<!--=========================================================================-->
<div class="doc_subsection">
<a name="executionengine">Interpreter and JIT Improvements</a>
</div>

<div class="doc_text">

<ul>
<li>LLVM has a new "EngineBuilder" class which makes it more obvious how to
    set up and configure an ExecutionEngine (a JIT or interpreter).</li>
<li>The JIT now supports generating more than 16M of code.</li>
<li>When configured with --with-oprofile, the JIT can now inform OProfile about
     JIT'd code, allowing OProfile to get line number and function name
     information for JIT'd functions.</li>
<li>When "libffi" is available, the LLVM interpreter now uses it, which supports
    calling almost arbitrary external (natively compiled) functions.</li>
<li>Clients of the JIT can now register a 'JITEventListener' object to receive
    callbacks when the JIT emits or frees machine code. The OProfile support
    uses this mechanism.</li>
</ul>

</div>

<!--=========================================================================-->
<div class="doc_subsection">
<a name="codegen">Target Independent Code Generator Improvements</a>
</div>

<div class="doc_text">

<p>We have put a significant amount of work into the code generator
infrastructure, which allows us to implement more aggressive algorithms and make
it run faster:</p>

<ul>

<li>The <tt>llc -asm-verbose</tt> option (exposed from llvm-gcc as <tt>-dA</tt>
    and clang as <tt>-fverbose-asm</tt> or <tt>-dA</tt>) now adds a lot of 
    useful information in comments to
    the generated .s file.  This information includes location information (if
    built with <tt>-g</tt>) and loop nest information.</li>
<li>The code generator now supports a new MachineVerifier pass which is useful
    for finding bugs in targets and codegen passes.</li>
<li>The Machine LICM is now enabled by default.  It hoists instructions out of
    loops (such as constant pool loads, loads from read-only stubs, vector
    constant synthesization code, etc.) and is currently configured to only do
    so when the hoisted operation can be rematerialized.</li>
<li>The Machine Sinking pass is now enabled by default.  This pass moves
    side-effect free operations down the CFG so that they are executed on fewer
    paths through a function.</li>
<li>The code generator now performs "stack slot coloring" of register spills,
    which allows spill slots to be reused.  This leads to smaller stack frames
    in cases where there are lots of register spills.</li>
<li>The register allocator has many improvements to take better advantage of
    commutable operations, various spiller peephole optimizations, and can now
    coalesce cross-register-class copies.</li>
<li>Tblgen now supports multiclass inheritance and a number of new string and
    list operations like !(subst), !(foreach), !car, !cdr, !null, !if, !cast.
    These make the .td files more expressive and allow more aggressive factoring
    of duplication across instruction patterns.</li>
<li>Target-specific intrinsics can now be added without having to hack VMCore to
    add them.  This makes it easier to maintain out-of-tree targets.</li>
<li>The instruction selector is better at propagating information about values
    (such as whether they are sign/zero extended etc.) across basic block
    boundaries.</li>
<li>The SelectionDAG datastructure has new nodes for representing buildvector
    and <a href="http://llvm.org/PR2957">vector shuffle</a> operations.  This
    makes operations and pattern matching more efficient and easier to get
    right.</li>
<li>The Prolog/Epilog Insertion Pass now has experimental support for performing
    the "shrink wrapping" optimization, which moves spills and reloads around in
    the CFG to avoid doing saves on paths that don't need them.</li>
<li>LLVM includes new experimental support for writing ELF .o files directly
    from the compiler.  It works well for many simple C testcases, but doesn't
    support exception handling, debug info, inline assembly, etc.</li>
<li>Targets can now specify register allocation hints through
    MachineRegisterInfo::setRegAllocationHint. A regalloc hint consists of hint
    type and physical register number. A hint type of zero specifies a register
    allocation preference. Other hint type values are target specific which are
    resolved by TargetRegisterInfo::ResolveRegAllocHint. An example is the ARM
    target which uses register hints to request that the register allocator
    provide an even / odd register pair to two virtual registers.</li>

<a name="x86">X86-32 and X86-64 Target Improvements</a>
</div>

<div class="doc_text">
<p>New features of the X86 target include:
</p>

<ul>

<li>SSE 4.2 builtins are now supported.</li>
<li>GCC-compatible soft float modes are now supported, which are typically used
    by OS kernels.</li>
<li>X86-64 now models implicit zero extensions better, which allows the code
    generator to remove a lot of redundant zexts.  It also models the 8-bit "H"
    registers as subregs, which allows them to be used in some tricky
    situations.</li>
<li>X86-64 now supports the "local exec" and "initial exec" thread local storage
    model.</li>
<li>The vector forms of the <a href="LangRef.html#i_icmp">icmp</a> and <a
    href="LangRef.html#i_fcmp">fcmp</a> instructions now select to efficient
    SSE operations.</li>
<li>Support for the win64 calling conventions have improved.  The primary
    missing feature is support for varargs function definitions.  It seems to
    work well for many win64 JIT purposes.</li>
<li>The X86 backend has preliminary support for <a 
    href="CodeGenerator.html#x86_memory">mapping address spaces to segment
    register references</a>.  This allows you to write GS or FS relative memory
    accesses directly in LLVM IR for cases where you know exactly what you're
    doing (such as in an OS kernel).  There are some known problems with this
    support, but it works in simple cases.</li>
<li>The X86 code generator has been refactored to move all global variable
    reference logic to one place
    (<tt>X86Subtarget::ClassifyGlobalReference</tt>) which
    makes it easier to reason about.</li>

<a name="newapis">New Useful APIs</a>
</div>

<div class="doc_text">

<p>This release includes a number of new APIs that are used internally, which
   may also be useful for external clients.
</p>

<ul>
<li>New <a href="http://llvm.org/doxygen/PrettyStackTrace_8h-source.html">
    PrettyStackTrace classes</a> allows crashes of llvm tools (and applications
    that integrate them) to provide more detailed indication of what the
    compiler was doing at the time of the crash (e.g. running a pass).
    At the top level for each LLVM tool, it includes the command line arguments.
    </li>
<li>New <a href="http://llvm.org/doxygen/StringRef_8h-source.html">StringRef</a>
    and <a href="http://llvm.org/doxygen/Twine_8h-source.html">Twine</a> classes
    make operations on character ranges and
    string concatenation to be more efficient.  StringRef is just a <tt>const
    char*</tt> with a length, Twine is a light-weight rope.</li>
<li>LLVM has new WeakVH, AssertingVH and CallbackVH classes, which make it
    easier to write LLVM IR transformations.  WeakVH is automatically drops to
    null when the referenced Value is deleted, and is updated across a
    replaceAllUsesWith operation.  AssertingVH aborts the program if the
    referenced value is destroyed while it is being referenced.  CallbackVH is
    a customizable class for handling value references.  See <a
    href="http://llvm.org/doxygen/ValueHandle_8h-source.html">ValueHandle.h</a> 
    for more information.</li>
<li>The new '<a href="http://llvm.org/doxygen/Triple_8h-source.html">Triple
    </a>' class centralizes a lot of logic that reasons about target
    triples.</li>
<li>The new '<a href="http://llvm.org/doxygen/ErrorHandling_8h-source.html">
    llvm_report_error()</a>' set of APIs allows tools to embed the LLVM
    optimizer and backend and recover from previously unrecoverable errors.</li>
<li>LLVM has new abstractions for <a 
    href="http://llvm.org/doxygen/Atomic_8h-source.html">atomic operations</a>
    and <a href="http://llvm.org/doxygen/RWMutex_8h-source.html">reader/writer
    locks</a>.</li>
<li>LLVM has new <a href="http://llvm.org/doxygen/SourceMgr_8h-source.html">
    SourceMgr and SMLoc classes</a> which implement caret diagnostics and basic
    include stack processing for simple parsers. It is used by tablegen,
    llvm-mc, the .ll parser and FileCheck.</li>
</ul>

<!--=========================================================================-->
<div class="doc_subsection">
<a name="otherimprovements">Other Improvements and New Features</a>
</div>

<div class="doc_text">
<p>Other miscellaneous features include:</p>

<ul>
<li>LLVM now includes a new internal '<a 
    href="http://llvm.org/cmds/FileCheck.html">FileCheck</a>' tool which allows
    writing much more accurate regression tests that run faster.  Please see the
    <a href="TestingGuide.html#FileCheck">FileCheck section of the Testing
    Guide</a> for more information.</li>
<li>LLVM profile information support has been significantly improved to produce
correct use counts, and has support for edge profiling with reduced runtime
overhead.  Combined, the generated profile information is both more correct and
imposes about half as much overhead (2.6. from 12% to 6% overhead on SPEC
CPU2000).</li>
<li>The C bindings (in the llvm/include/llvm-c directory) include many newly
    supported APIs.</li>
<li>LLVM 2.6 includes a brand new experimental LLVM bindings to the Ada2005
    programming language.</li>

<li>The LLVMC driver has several new features:
  <ul>
  <li>Dynamic plugins now work on Windows.</li>
  <li>New option property: init. Makes possible to provide default values for
      options defined in plugins (interface to cl::init).</li>
  <li>New example: Skeleton, shows how to create a standalone LLVMC-based

<div class="doc_subsection">
<a name="changes">Major Changes and Removed Features</a>
</div>

<div class="doc_text">

<p>If you're already an LLVM user or developer with out-of-tree changes based
on LLVM 2.5, this section lists some "gotchas" that you may run into upgrading
from the previous release.</p>

<ul>
<li>The Itanium (IA64) backend has been removed.  It was not actively supported
    and had bitrotted.</li>
<li>The BigBlock register allocator has been removed, it had also bitrotted.</li>
<li>The C Backend (-march=c) is no longer considered part of the LLVM release
criteria.  We still want it to work, but no one is maintaining it and it lacks
support for arbitrary precision integers and other important IR features.</li>

<li>All LLVM tools now default to overwriting their output file, behaving more
    like standard unix tools.  Previously, this only happened with the '-f'
    option.</li>
<li>LLVM build now builds all libraries as .a files instead of some
  libraries as relinked .o files.  This requires some APIs like
  InitializeAllTargets.h.
  </li>
</ul>


<p>In addition, many APIs have changed in this release.  Some of the major LLVM
API changes are:</p>

<ul>
<li>All uses of hash_set and hash_map have been removed from the LLVM tree and
    the wrapper headers have been removed.</li>
<li>The llvm/Streams.h and DOUT member of Debug.h have been removed.  The
    llvm::Ostream class has been completely removed and replaced with uses of
    raw_ostream.</li>
<li>LLVM's global uniquing tables for <tt>Type</tt>s and <tt>Constant</tt>s have
    been privatized into members of an <tt>LLVMContext</tt>.  A number of APIs
    now take an <tt>LLVMContext</tt> as a parameter.  To smooth the transition
    for clients that will only ever use a single context, the new 
    <tt>getGlobalContext()</tt> API can be used to access a default global 
    context which can be passed in any and all cases where a context is 
    required.
<li>The <tt>getABITypeSize</tt> methods are now called <tt>getAllocSize</tt>.</li>
<li>The <tt>Add</tt>, <tt>Sub</tt> and <tt>Mul</tt> operators are no longer
    overloaded for floating-point types. Floating-point addition, subtraction
    and multiplication are now represented with new operators <tt>FAdd</tt>,
    <tt>FSub</tt> and <tt>FMul</tt>. In the <tt>IRBuilder</tt> API,
    <tt>CreateAdd</tt>, <tt>CreateSub</tt>, <tt>CreateMul</tt> and
    <tt>CreateNeg</tt> should only be used for integer arithmetic now;
    <tt>CreateFAdd</tt>, <tt>CreateFSub</tt>, <tt>CreateFMul</tt> and
    <tt>CreateFNeg</tt> should now be used for floating-point arithmetic.</li>
<li>The DynamicLibrary class can no longer be constructed, its functionality has
    moved to static member functions.</li>
<li><tt>raw_fd_ostream</tt>'s constructor for opening a given filename now
    takes an extra <tt>Force</tt> argument. If <tt>Force</tt> is set to
    <tt>false</tt>, an error will be reported if a file with the given name
    already exists. If <tt>Force</tt> is set to <tt>true</tt>, the file will
    be silently truncated (which is the behavior before this flag was
    added).</li>
<li><tt>SCEVHandle</tt> no longer exists, because reference counting is no
longer done for <tt>SCEV*</tt> objects, instead <tt>const SCEV*</tt> should be
used.</li>

<li>Many APIs, notably <tt>llvm::Value</tt>, now use the <tt>StringRef</tt>
and <tt>Twine</tt> classes instead of passing <tt>const char*</tt>
or <tt>std::string</tt>, as described in
the <a href="ProgrammersManual.html#string_apis">Programmer's Manual</a>. Most
clients should be unaffected by this transition, unless they are used to
<tt>Value::getName()</tt> returning a string. Here are some tips on updating to
2.6:
  <ul>
    <li><tt>getNameStr()</tt> is still available, and matches the old
      behavior. Replacing <tt>getName()</tt> calls with this is an safe option,
      although more efficient alternatives are now possible.</li>

    <li>If you were just relying on <tt>getName()</tt> being able to be sent to
      a <tt>std::ostream</tt>, consider migrating
      to <tt>llvm::raw_ostream</tt>.</li>
      
    <li>If you were using <tt>getName().c_str()</tt> to get a <tt>const
        char*</tt> pointer to the name, you can use <tt>getName().data()</tt>.
        Note that this string (as before), may not be the entire name if the
        name contains embedded null characters.</li>

    <li>If you were using operator plus on the result of <tt>getName()</tt> and
      treating the result as an <tt>std::string</tt>, you can either
      use <tt>Twine::str</tt> to get the result as an <tt>std::string</tt>, or
      could move to a <tt>Twine</tt> based design.</li>

    <li><tt>isName()</tt> should be replaced with comparison
      against <tt>getName()</tt> (this is now efficient).
  </ul>
</li>

<li>The registration interfaces for backend Targets has changed (what was
previously TargetMachineRegistry). For backend authors, see the <a
href="WritingAnLLVMBackend.html#TargetRegistration">Writing An LLVM Backend</a>
guide. For clients, the notable API changes are:
  <ul>
    <li><tt>TargetMachineRegistry</tt> has been renamed
      to <tt>TargetRegistry</tt>.</li>

    <li>Clients should move to using the <tt>TargetRegistry::lookupTarget()</tt>
      function to find targets.</li>
  </ul>
</li>
</ul>

<div class="doc_text">

<p>LLVM is known to work on the following platforms:</p>

<ul>
<li>Intel and AMD machines (IA32, X86-64, AMD64, EMT-64) running Red Hat
    Linux, Fedora Core, FreeBSD and AuroraUX (and probably other unix-like
    systems).</li>
<li>PowerPC and X86-based Mac OS X systems, running 10.3 and above in 32-bit

</div>

<div class="doc_text">
The llvm-gcc 4.2 Ada compiler works fairly well; however, this is not a mature
technology, and problems should be expected.
<ul>
<li>The Ada front-end currently only builds on X86-32.  This is mainly due
to lack of trampoline support (pointers to nested functions) on other platforms.
However, it <a href="http://llvm.org/PR2006">also fails to build on X86-64</a>
which does support trampolines.</li>
<li>The Ada front-end <a href="http://llvm.org/PR2007">fails to bootstrap</a>.
This is due to lack of LLVM support for <tt>setjmp</tt>/<tt>longjmp</tt> style
exception handling, which is used internally by the compiler.
Workaround: configure with --disable-bootstrap.</li>
<li>The c380004, <a href="http://llvm.org/PR2010">c393010</a>
and <a href="http://llvm.org/PR2421">cxg2021</a> ACATS tests fail
(c380004 also fails with gcc-4.2 mainline).
If the compiler is built with checks disabled then <a href="http://llvm.org/PR2010">c393010</a>
causes the compiler to go into an infinite loop, using up all system memory.</li>
<li>Some GCC specific Ada tests continue to crash the compiler.</li>
<li>The -E binder option (exception backtraces)
<a href="http://llvm.org/PR1982">does not work</a> and will result in programs
crashing if an exception is raised.  Workaround: do not use -E.</li>
<li>Only discrete types <a href="http://llvm.org/PR1981">are allowed to start
or finish at a non-byte offset</a> in a record.  Workaround: do not pack records
or use representation clauses that result in a field of a non-discrete type
starting or finishing in the middle of a byte.</li>
<li>The <tt>lli</tt> interpreter <a href="http://llvm.org/PR2009">considers
'main' as generated by the Ada binder to be invalid</a>.
Workaround: hand edit the file to use pointers for <tt>argv</tt> and

<p>The Llvm.Linkage module is broken, and has incorrect values. Only
Llvm.Linkage.External, Llvm.Linkage.Available_externally, and
Llvm.Linkage.Link_once will be correct. If you need any of the other linkage
modes, you'll have to write an external C library in order to expose the
functionality. This has been fixed in the trunk.</p>
