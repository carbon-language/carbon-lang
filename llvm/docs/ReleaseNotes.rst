   These are in-progress notes for the upcoming LLVM 14 release.
   Release notes for previous releases can be found on
   `the Download Page <https://releases.llvm.org/download.html>`_.


Introduction
============

This document contains the release notes for the LLVM Compiler Infrastructure,
release 14.0.0.  Here we describe the status of LLVM, including major improvements
from the previous release, improvements in various subprojects of LLVM, and
some of the current users of the code.  All LLVM releases may be downloaded
from the `LLVM releases web site <https://llvm.org/releases/>`_.

For more information about LLVM, including information about the latest
release, please check out the `main LLVM web site <https://llvm.org/>`_.  If you
have questions or comments, the `LLVM Developer's Mailing List
<https://lists.llvm.org/mailman/listinfo/llvm-dev>`_ is a good place to send
them.

Note that if you are reading this file from a Git checkout or the main
LLVM web page, this document applies to the *next* release, not the current
one.  To see the release notes for a specific release, please see the `releases
page <https://llvm.org/releases/>`_.

Non-comprehensive list of changes in this release
=================================================
.. NOTE
   For small 1-3 sentence descriptions, just add an entry at the end of
   this list. If your description won't fit comfortably in one bullet
   point (e.g. maybe you would like to give an example of the
   functionality, or simply have a lot to talk about), see the `NOTE` below
   for adding a new subsection.


.. NOTE
   If you would like to document a larger change, then you can add a
   subsection about it right here. You can copy the following boilerplate
   and un-indent it (the indentation causes it to be inside this comment).

   Special New Feature
   -------------------

   Makes programs 10x faster by doing Special New Thing.

* ...

Changes to the LLVM IR
----------------------

* Using the legacy pass manager for the optimization pipeline is deprecated and
  will be removed after LLVM 14. In the meantime, only minimal effort will be
  made to maintain the legacy pass manager for the optimization pipeline.
* Max allowed integer type was reduced from 2^24-1 bits to 2^23 bits.
* Max allowed alignment was increased from 2^29 to 2^32.

Changes to building LLVM
------------------------

* ...

Changes to TableGen
-------------------

Changes to the AArch64 Backend
------------------------------

* Added support for the Armv9-A, Armv9.1-A and Armv9.2-A architectures.
* The compiler now recognises the "tune-cpu" function attribute to support
  the use of the -mtune frontend flag. This allows certain scheduling features
  and optimisations to be enabled independently of the architecture. If the
  "tune-cpu" attribute is absent it tunes according to the "target-cpu".

Changes to the ARM Backend
--------------------------

* Added support for the Armv9-A, Armv9.1-A and Armv9.2-A architectures.
* Added support for the Armv8.1-M PACBTI-M extension.

Changes to the MIPS Target
--------------------------

During this release ...

Changes to the Hexagon Target
-----------------------------

* ...

Changes to the PowerPC Target
-----------------------------

During this release ...

Changes to the X86 Target
-------------------------

During this release ...

* Support for ``AVX512-FP16`` instructions has been added.

Changes to the AMDGPU Target
-----------------------------

During this release ...

Changes to the AVR Target
-----------------------------

During this release ...

Changes to the WebAssembly Target
---------------------------------

During this release ...

Changes to the OCaml bindings
-----------------------------


Changes to the C API
--------------------

* ``LLVMSetInstDebugLocation`` has been deprecated in favor of the more general
  ``LLVMAddMetadataToInst``.

Changes to the Go bindings
--------------------------


Changes to the FastISel infrastructure
--------------------------------------

* ...

Changes to the DAG infrastructure
---------------------------------


Changes to the Debug Info
---------------------------------

During this release ...

Changes to the LLVM tools
---------------------------------

* llvm-cov: `-name-allowlist` is now accepted in addition to `-name-whitelist`.
  `-name-whitelist` is marked as deprecated and to be removed in future
  releases.

Changes to LLDB
---------------------------------

* A change in Clang's type printing has changed the way LLDB names array types
  (from ``int [N]`` to ``int[N]``) - LLDB pretty printer type name matching
  code may need to be updated to handle this.
* The ``memory read`` command now ignores non-address bits in start and end
  addresses. In addition, non-address bits will not be shown in the addresses
  in the output.

Changes to Sanitizers
---------------------

External Open Source Projects Using LLVM 14

Additional Information
======================

A wide variety of additional information is available on the `LLVM web page
<https://llvm.org/>`_, in particular in the `documentation
<https://llvm.org/docs/>`_ section.  The web page also contains versions of the
API documentation which is up-to-date with the Git version of the source
code.  You can access versions of these documents specific to this release by
going into the ``llvm/docs/`` directory in the LLVM tree.
