// This file implements the SampleProfileLoader transformation. This pass
// reads a profile file generated by a sampling profiler (e.g. Linux Perf -
// http://perf.wiki.kernel.org/) and generates IR metadata to reflect the
// profile information in the given profile.
//
// This pass generates branch weight annotations on the IR:
//
// - prof: Represents branch weights. This annotation is added to branches
//      to indicate the weights of each edge coming out of the branch.
//      The weight of each edge is the weight of the target block for
//      that edge. The weight of a block B is computed as the maximum
//      number of samples found in B.

/// d- [OPTIONAL] Potential call targets and samples. If present, this
///    line contains a call instruction. This models both direct and
