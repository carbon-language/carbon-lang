/// This transformation implements the well known scalar replacement of
/// aggregates transformation. It tries to identify promotable elements of an
/// aggregate alloca, and promote them to registers. It will also try to
/// convert uses of an element (or set of elements) of an alloca into a vector
/// or bitfield-style integer scalar if appropriate.
///
/// It works to do this with minimal slicing of the alloca so that regions
/// which are merely transferred in and out of external memory remain unchanged
/// and are not decomposed to scalar code.
///
/// Because this also performs alloca promotion, it can be thought of as also
/// serving the purpose of SSA formation. The algorithm iterates on the
/// function until all opportunities for promotion have been realized.

/// 1) It takes allocations of aggregates and analyzes the ways in which they

///    integer value, or it can involve speculating operations on a PHI or
///    select to be a PHI or select of the results.
/// 3) Finally, this will try to detect a pattern of accesses which map cleanly
///    onto insert and extract operations on a vector value, and convert them to
///    this form. By doing so, it will enable promotion of vector aggregates to
