"""A tool for extracting a list of symbols to export

When exporting symbols from a dll or exe we either need to mark the symbols in
the source code as __declspec(dllexport) or supply a list of symbols to the
linker. This program automates the latter by inspecting the symbol tables of a
list of link inputs and deciding which of those symbols need to be exported.

We can't just export all the defined symbols, as there's a limit of 65535
exported symbols and in clang we go way over that, particularly in a debug
build. Therefore a large part of the work is pruning symbols either which can't
be imported, or which we think are things that have definitions in public header
files (i.e. template instantiations) and we would get defined in the thing
importing these symbols anyway.
