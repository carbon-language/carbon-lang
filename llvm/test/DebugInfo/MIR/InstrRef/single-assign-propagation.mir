#
# This test is designed to stimulate a simplification of variable-value
# propagation in InstrRefBasedLDV. When we only have a single assignment of
# a variable, we don't have to completely enumerate all the PHIs the variable
# has and then value propagate through them: the variable value is available
# only in those blocks dominated by the assignment. Example in this test:
#
#             entry
#            /  |  \
#           /   v   \
#          /   bb1   \    <--- Single variable assignment happens here
#         /   /   \   \
#        /   v     v   \
#        | bb2     bb3 |
#        |   \    /    |
#        |    v  v     |
#        |     bb4     |
#         \   /   \    /
#          v v     v  v
#           bb5    bb6    <---  Dominance frontier is here
#
# The general InstrRefBasedLDV algorithm takes this CFG, places PHIs at bb5 and
# bb6, then value-propagates until it's determined that they can't be
# eliminated. Then, we determine that there's no machine location for such PHIs,
# and no variable location is emitted.
#
# The fast way of doing this: observe that the variable value can never extend
# past the dominance frontier of the block where the assignment happens. So
# just propagate the variable value into the dominated blocks, and avoid the
# general algorithm.
#
# Doing so introduces a functional change: VarLocBasedLDV won't propagate
# variable locations through out-of-scope blocks, and InstrRefBasedLDV tries to
# replicate VarLocBasedLDV most of the time. In the MIR below, bb2 is out of
# scope. This effectively becomes another variable assignment (of undef), which
# requires full SSA and value propagation to emulate what VarLocBasedLDV did.
# Applying this speed optimisation makes us diverge from what VarLocBasedLDV
# does by not treating the out-of-scope block as an effective undef assignment,
# hence this test.
#
# CHECK-LABEL: bb.1:
# CHECK:       DBG_VALUE
# CHECK-LABEL: bb.2:
## No location here because it's out-of-scope.
# CHECK-LABEL: bb.3:
# CHECK:       DBG_VALUE
# CHECK-LABEL: bb.4:
# CHECK:       DBG_VALUE
#
## VarLocBasedLDV will take the DBG_VALUE in the assignment block, propagate
## to bb.3, but not into bb.4 because of the intervening out-of-scope block.
#
# VARLOC-LABEL: bb.1:
# VARLOC:       DBG_VALUE
