# Test that we can write source file names to PDBs and read them back.
# Because the subsection the file names are stored in is 4-byte
# aligned, there is a possibility of misaligning the file names. This
# will cause them to be read back empty or truncated.  To guard
# against this, we test with two different lengths of file name data
# that differ by one byte, so that at least one of those will only
# pass if alignment is implemented correctly.
