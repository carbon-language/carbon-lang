; This testcase verifies that we can produce a minimal PDB, while
; serving as an example for how to construct a minimal PDB for other
; testcases.  It takes as input a small fragment of hand-written yaml
; that specifies nothing about the PDB other than a definition of one
; symbol that it contains.  Then it produces a PDB, and uses the
; resulting PDB to go back to yaml, and verify that the resulting yaml
; is identical.

; RUN: llvm-pdbutil yaml2pdb -pdb=%t.pdb %p/Inputs/one-symbol.yaml
