; This test checks to make sure that constant exprs fold in some simple situations

; RUN: as < %s | dis | not grep cast

%A = global int* cast (sbyte* null to int*)  ; Cast null -> fold
%B = global int** cast (int** %A to int**)   ; Cast to same type -> fold
%C = global int cast (long 42 to int)        ; Integral casts
%D = global int* cast(float* cast (int* %C to float*) to int*)  ; cast of cast ptr->ptr
%E = global int cast(float* cast (sbyte 5 to float*) to int)  ; int -> ptr -> int

; Test folding of binary instrs
%F = global int* cast(int add (int 5, int -5) to int*)
%G = global int* cast(int sub (int 5, int 5) to int*)
