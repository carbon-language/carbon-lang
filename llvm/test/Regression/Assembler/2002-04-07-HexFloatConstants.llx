; This testcase checks to make sure that the assembler can handle floating 
; point constants in IEEE hex format. This also checks that the disassembler,
; when presented with a FP constant that cannot be represented exactly in 
; exponential form, outputs it correctly in hex format.  This is a distillation
; of the bug that was causing the Olden Health benchmark to output incorrect
; results!
