# We detect thumb triples from the binaries, because those are the only ones
# that are guaranteed to be able to generate a Target instance (for example
# we would detect armv7m-apple-darwin as non-thumb triple, but you can't
# instantiate a Target from that). In the user-visible architecture names, and
# in the lipo invocation, we need to rewrite the thumb arch names to the arm
# ones.
