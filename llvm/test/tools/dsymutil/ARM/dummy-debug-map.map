# This is a dummy debug map used for some tests where the contents of the
# map are just an implementation detail. The tests wanting to use that file
# should put all there object files in an explicitely named sub-directory
# of Inputs, and they should be named 1.o, 2.o, ...
# As not finding an object file or symbols isn't a fatal error for dsymutil,
# you can extend this file with as much object files and symbols as needed.
