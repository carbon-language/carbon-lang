The tested object file has been created by the dummy Objective-C code:
@interface Foo
@end

@implementation Foo
@end

int main() { return 0; }

compiled for i386. This create an absolute symbol .objc_class_name_Foo
We must not consider this symbol for debug info linking as its address
might conflict with other real symbols in the same file.

CHECK-NOT: objc_class_name_Foo
