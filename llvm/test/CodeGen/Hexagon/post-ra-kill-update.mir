# RUN: llc -march=hexagon -mcpu=hexagonv60 -run-pass post-RA-sched -o - %s | FileCheck %s

# The post-RA scheduler reorders S2_lsr_r_p and S2_lsr_r_p_or. Both of them
# use r9, and the last of the two kills it. The kill flag fixup did not
# correctly update the flag, resulting in both instructions killing r9.

# CHECK-LABEL: name: foo
# Check for no-kill of r9 in the first instruction, after reordering:
# CHECK: $d7 = S2_lsr_r_p_or killed $d7, killed $d1, $r9
# CHECK: $d13 = S2_lsr_r_p killed $d0, killed $r9
