# The hoisting of common instructions from successors could cause registers
# to no longer be live-in in the successor blocks. The liveness was updated
# to include potential new live-in registres, but not to remove registers
# that were no longer live-in.
# This could cause if-converter to generate incorrect code.
#
# In this testcase, the "r1 = A2_sxth killed r0" was hoisted, and since r0
# was killed, it was no longer live-in in either successor. The if-converter
# then created code, where the first predicated instruction has incorrect
# implicit use of r0:
#
# %bb.0:
#     Live Ins: %R0
#         %R1 = A2_sxth killed %R0               ; hoisted, kills r0
#         A2_nop implicit-def %P0
#         %R0 = C2_cmoveit %P0, 2, implicit %R0 ; predicated A2_tfrsi
#         %R0 = C2_cmoveif killed %P0, 1, implicit %R0 ; predicated A2_tfrsi
#         %R0 = A2_add killed %R0, killed %R1
#         J2_jumpr %R31, implicit dead %PC
#

# CHECK: %r1 = A2_sxth killed %r0
# CHECK: %r0 = C2_cmoveit %p0, 2
# CHECK-NOT: implicit-def %r0
# CHECK: %r0 = C2_cmoveif killed %p0, 1, implicit killed %r0
