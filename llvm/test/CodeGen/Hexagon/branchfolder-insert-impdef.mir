# Branch folding will perform tail merging of bb.1 and bb.2, and bb.2 will
# become the common tail. The use of R0 in bb.2 is <undef> while the
# corresponding use in bb.1 is not. The common tail will have the <undef>
# flag removed, which will cause R0 to become a live-in to bb.2. The problem
# is that R0 is not live-out from all predecessors of bb.2, namely is not
# live-out from bb.0. To remedy that, the branch folder should add an
# IMPLICIT_DEF to that block.
