; Most important point here is that the promotion of the i1 works
; correctly. Previously LLVM thought that i64 was the appropriate SetCC output,
; which meant it proceded in two steps and produced an i64 -> i64 any_ext which
; couldn't be selected and faulted.

; It was expecting the smallest legal promotion of i1 to be the preferred SetCC
; type, so we'll satisfy it (this actually arguably gives better code anyway,
; with flag-manipulation operations allowed to use W-registers).
