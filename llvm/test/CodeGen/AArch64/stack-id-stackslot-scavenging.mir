# Ensure that an object with a different stack-id is not allocated to a
# callee-save slot using stack-slot scavenging. This test saves X28 which
# creates a hole in the CSR stack region, but it should not be saved to.
# Instead of saving to SP + 1 (which would be the hole in the region), it
# should save to SP + 2 (since AArch64 codegen currently does not support
# (and thus allocate) objects with a stack-id > 0).
