# REQUIRES: asserts

# This is to demonstrate what kind of bugs we're missing w/o some kind
# of validation for LegalizerInfo: G_INTTOPTR could only be legal /
# could be legalized if its destination operand has a pointer type and
# its source - a scalar type of an appropriate size. This test meets
# the requirements for type index 0 (the pointer) and LLT-size
# requirements for type index 1 (64 bits for AArch64), but has a
# non-scalar (vector) type for type index 1. The Legalizer is expected
# to fail on it with an appropriate error message. Prior to
# LegalizerInfo::verify AArch64 legalizer had a subtle bug in its
# definition that caused it to accept the following MIR as legal.
# Namely, it checked that type index 0 is either s64 or p0 and
# implicitly declared any type for type index 1 as legal (as soon as
# its size is 64 bits). As LegalizerInfo::verify asserts on such a
# definition due to type index 1 not being covered by a specific
# action (not just `unsupportedIf`) it forces to review the definition
# and fix the mistake: check that type index 0 is p0 and type index 1
# is s64.

# CHECK: Bad machine code: operand types must be all-vector or all-scalar
# CHECK: LLVM ERROR: Found 1 machine code errors.
