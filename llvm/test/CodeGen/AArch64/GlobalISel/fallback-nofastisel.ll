; This test uses big endian in order to force an abort since it's not currently supported for GISel.
; The purpose is to check that we don't fall back to FastISel. Checking the pass structure is insufficient
; because the FastISel is set up in the SelectionDAGISel, so it doesn't appear on the pass structure.
