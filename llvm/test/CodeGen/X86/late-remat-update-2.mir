# PR40061: %t2 = %t1 is rematerialized and %t1 is added into toBeUpdated set
# to postpone its live interval update. After the rematerialization, the live
# interval of %t1 is larger than necessary. Then %t1 is merged into %t3 and %t1
# gets removed. After the merge, %t3 contains live interval larger than
# necessary. Because %t3 is not in toBeUpdated set so its live interval is not
# updated after register coalescing, and it will break some assumption in
# regalloc. This test wants to check the live interval is up-to-date after
# register coalescing.
#
# To prevent the test from taking effect only in assert enabled mode, we want
# to achieve the test goal without dumping regalloc trace. We add strong hint
# to allocate both %t1 and %t2 to $rax register. If the %t1's live interval is
# not shrinked properly after register coalescing, %t1 and %t2 will not be
# both allocated to $rax because of inference, and we utilize the fact to
# achieve the test goal. But note that the assumption only holds when we use
# regallocbasic instead of greedy because greedy can update the live interval
# in the process of splitting.
