; Another example of why forwarding across an acquire fence is problematic
; can be seen in a normal locking operation.  Say we had:
; *p = 5; unlock(l); lock(l); use(p);
; forwarding the store to p would be invalid.  A reasonable implementation
; of unlock and lock might be:
; unlock() { atomicrmw sub %l, 1 unordered; fence release }
; lock() { 
;   do {
;     %res = cmpxchg %p, 0, 1, monotonic monotonic
;   } while(!%res.success)
;   fence acquire;
; }
; Given we chose to forward across the release fence, we clearly can't forward
; across the acquire fence as well.
