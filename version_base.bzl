"""The base version of the Carbon repository.

The Carbon SemVer version is defined here and then exported to various layers
where it is needed. This is not the currently *released* version, but the
version under *active development*.

The current active development version is 0.0.0 -- we haven't yet made enough
progress towards our 0.1 milestone to meaningfully bump the version to that even
to describe the development activity. We also never plan to make even a
non-development pre-release of 0.0.0, only nightly development pre-releases are
expected.

For more details on Carbon's versioning, see:
TODO: Add link.
