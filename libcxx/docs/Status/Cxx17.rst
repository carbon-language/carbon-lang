Overview
================================

In November 2014, the C++ standard committee created a draft for the next version of the C++ standard, initially known as "C++1z".
In February 2017, the C++ standard committee approved this draft, and sent it to ISO for approval as C++17.

This page shows the status of libc++; the status of clang's support of the language features is `here <https://clang.llvm.org/cxx_status.html#cxx17>`__.

.. attention:: Features in unreleased drafts of the standard are subject to change.

The groups that have contributed papers:

-  CWG - Core Language Working group
-  LWG - Library working group
-  SG1 - Study group #1 (Concurrency working group)

.. note:: "Nothing to do" means that no library changes were needed to implement this change.
