libc++ Ranges Status

Overview
================================

This document contains the status of the C++20 Ranges library in libc++. It is used to
track both the status of the sub-projects of the ranges library and who is assigned to
these sub-projects. This is imperative to effective implementation so that work is not
duplicated and implementors are not blocked by each other.

If you are interested in contributing to the libc++ Ranges library, please send a message
to the #libcxx channel in the LLVM discord. Please *do not* start working on any of the
assigned items below.


Sub-Projects in the One Ranges Proposal

Misc. Items and TODOs
====================================

(Note: files with required updates will contain the TODO at the beginning of the list item
so they can be easily found via global search.)

    * TODO(XX_SPACESHIP_CONCEPTS): when spaceship support is added to various STL types, we need to update some concept tests.
