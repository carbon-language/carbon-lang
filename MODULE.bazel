"""Bazel modules.

`MODULE.bazel.lock` may change locally when `bazel` is exexcuted. This means one
of:

1.  `MODULE.bazel` is changing.
    -   Running `bazel mod deps` provides a canonical update to
        `MODULE.bazel.lock`; include the changes.
    -   GitHub test actions may also identify platform-specific lockfile
        updates.
2.  The `bazel` version doesn't match the version used to generate the
    `MODULE.bazel.lock`.
    -   Bazel releases can change the lock file contents.
    -   We use Bazelisk in order to keep everyone using the same version:
        https://bazel.build/install/bazelisk
        -   Developers are encouraged to alias `bazel` to `bazelisk` for
            ease-of-use; some setups, like Homebrew, will include that with a
            `bazelisk` install.
        -   Contribution tools documentation includes `bazelisk` setup:
            https://github.com/carbon-language/carbon-lang/blob/trunk/docs/project/contribution_tools.md
    -   Make sure `bazelisk --version` (or `bazel --version`) matches the
        version in `.bazeliskrc`.
3.  The host platform hasn't yet been added to the lock file.
    -   Platforms tested with GitHub actions are kept up-to-date. Other
        platforms may fall out of sync due to `bazel` or dependency changes,
        and should be updated with a PR the same way a platform is added.
    -   Running `bazel mod deps` provides a canonical update to
        `MODULE.bazel.lock`; create a PR with those changes in order to include
        the host platform.
