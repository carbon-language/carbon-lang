-*- mlir/utils/vim/README -*-

This directory contains settings for the vim editor to work on MLIR *.mlir 
files.  It comes with filetype detection rules in the (ftdetect),
syntax highlighting (syntax), some minimal sensible default settings (ftplugin)
and indentation plugins (indent).

To install, copy all subdirectories to your $HOME/.vim/, or if you
prefer, create symlinks to the files here.

To enable highlighting inside the Markdown docs, one can add

```
let g:markdown_fenced_languages = ['mlir']
```

to `.vimrc`.
