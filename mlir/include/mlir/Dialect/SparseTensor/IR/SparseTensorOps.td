    in the future, such as pointers to buffers or runnable initialization
    code. The operation is provided as an anchor that materializes a properly
    typed sparse tensor with inital contents into a computation.

    Converts one sparse or dense tensor type to another tensor type. The rank
    of the source and destination types must match exactly, and the dimension
    sizes must either match exactly or relax from a static to a dynamic size.
    The sparse encoding of the two types can obviously be completely different.
    The name `convert` was preferred over `cast`, since the operation may incur
    a non-trivial cost.

    When converting between two different sparse tensor types, only explicitly
    stored values are moved from one underlying sparse storage format to
    the other. When converting from an unannotated dense tensor type to a
    sparse tensor type, an explicit test for nonzero values is used. When
    converting to an unannotated dense tensor type, implicit zeroes in the
    sparse storage format are made explicit. Note that the conversions can have
    non-trivial costs associated with them, since they may involve elaborate
    data structure transformations. Also, conversions from sparse tensor types
    into dense tensor types may be infeasible in terms of storage requirements.

    Examples:

    ```mlir
    %0 = sparse_tensor.convert %a : tensor<32x32xf32> to tensor<32x32xf32, #CSR>

    // runtime assertion that the source's dimension size is actually 100).
    %4 = sparse_tensor.convert %d : tensor<?xf64> to tensor<100xf64, #SV>

    [Pissanetzky84], in phase scan [Duff90], access pattern expansion [Bik96],

    The values and filled array have sizes that suffice for a *dense* innermost
    dimension (e.g. a full row for matrices). The added array and count are used
    to store new indices when a false value is encountered in the filled array.
    All arrays should be allocated before the loop (possibly even shared between
    loops in a future optimization) so that their *dense* initialization can be
    amortized over many iterations. Setting and resetting the dense arrays in
    the loop nest itself is kept *sparse* by only iterating over set elements
    through an indirection using the added array, so that the operations are

  let description = [{
      Defines a computation within a `linalg.generic` operation that takes two
      operands and executes one of the regions depending on whether both operands
      or either operand is nonzero (i.e. stored explicitly in the sparse storage
      format).

      Three regions are defined for the operation and must appear in this order:
      - overlap (elements present in both sparse tensors)
      - left (elements only present in the left sparse tensor)
      - right (element only present in the right sparse tensor)

      Each region contains a single block describing the computation and result.
      Every non-empty block must end with a sparse_tensor.yield and the return
      type must match the type of `output`. The primary region's block has two
      arguments, while the left and right region's block has only one argument.

      A region may also be declared empty (i.e. `left={}`), indicating that the
      region does not contribute to the output. For example, setting both
      `left={}` and `right={}` is equivalent to the intersection of the two
      inputs as only the overlap region will contribute values to the output.

      As a convenience, there is also a special token `identity` which can be
      used in place of the left or right region. This token indicates that
      the return value is the input value (i.e. func(%x) => return %x).
      As a practical example, setting `left=identity` and `right=identity`
      would be equivalent to a union operation where non-overlapping values
      in the inputs are copied to the output unchanged.

      Example of isEqual applied to intersecting elements only:
      ```mlir
      %C = sparse_tensor.init...
      %0 = linalg.generic #trait
        ins(%A: tensor<?xf64, #SparseVec>, %B: tensor<?xf64, #SparseVec>)

            right={}
          linalg.yield %result : i8

      Example returning +1 for existing values and -1 for missing values:
      ```mlir
      %result = sparse_tensor.unary %a : f64 to i32
        present={
          ^bb0(%x: f64):
            %ret = arith.constant 1 : i32
            sparse_tensor.yield %ret : i32
        }
        absent={
          %ret = arith.constant -1 : i32
          sparse_tensor.yield %ret : i32
        }
      ```

      Example showing a structural inversion (existing values become missing in
      the output, while missing values are filled with 1):
      ```mlir
      %result = sparse_tensor.unary %a : f64 to i64
        present={}
        absent={
          %ret = arith.constant 1 : i64
          sparse_tensor.yield %ret : i64
        }
      ```
  }];

  let regions = (region AnyRegion:$presentRegion, AnyRegion:$absentRegion);
  let assemblyFormat = [{
        $x attr-dict `:` type($x) `to` type($output) `\n`
        `present` `=` $presentRegion `\n`
        `absent` `=` $absentRegion
  }];
  let hasVerifier = 1;
