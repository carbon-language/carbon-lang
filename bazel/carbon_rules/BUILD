# Flag controlling whether the target config is used for the `carbon_*` Bazel
# rules. The default is to use the exec config as that is more correct in cases
# where the target config is not compatible with the exec (cross compiling), and
# for library users of Carbon likely the most efficient as it will provide an
# optimized toolchain.
#
# However, for building the Carbon project itself, this will roughly double the
# build cost by forcing a build in both target and exec config. As a consequence
# we disable the flag in the `.bazelrc` of the project for its builds.
