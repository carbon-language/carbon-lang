# Test breaking on symbols and printing variables when a DW_TAG_subprogram uses
# DW_AT_ranges instead of DW_AT_low_pc/DW_AT_high_pc.  While the assembly here
# is a bit unrealistic - it's a single-entry range using DWARFv4 which isn't
# useful for anything (a single-entry range with DWARFv5 can reduce address
# relocations, and multi-entry ranges can be used for function sections), but
# it's the simplest thing to test. If anyone's updating this test at some
# point, feel free to replace it with another equivalent test if it's
# especially useful, but don't dismiss it as pointless just because it's a bit
# weird.

# * Using volatile writes to create instructions the location may be valid over
# * Using two values for the variable so it is described by a location list,
#   not a single location description
# * Not using function calls, so that the function has no frame pointer
#   initialization/no prologue instructions, so the location of "var" is valid
#   at the start of the function, so 'image lookup -v -s main' will include it.
