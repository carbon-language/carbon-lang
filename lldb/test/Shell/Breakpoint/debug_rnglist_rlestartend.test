# Test shows that LDLB is able to handle DW_RLE_start_end entries properly.

# The following code and invocation were used to produce asm file.
# clang -O0 -gdwarf-5 test.cpp -S -o test.s -fuse-ld=lld -ffunction-sections
# It was edited to use DW_RLE_start_end, compiled and converted to yaml.
# The yaml was manually reduced.

# //test.cpp:
# int zed() { 
#  return 1;
# }
#
# int main() {
#  return zed();
# }

# clang and LLD versions were 8.0.0 (trunk 344035)
