/// @brief This class works with SearchFilter to resolve logical breakpoints to their
/// of concrete breakpoint locations.
//----------------------------------------------------------------------

//----------------------------------------------------------------------
/// General Outline:
/// The BreakpointResolver is a Searcher.  In that protocol,
/// the SearchFilter asks the question "At what depth of the symbol context
/// descent do you want your callback to get called?" of the filter.  The resolver
/// answers this question (in the GetDepth method) and provides the resolution callback.
/// Each Breakpoint has a BreakpointResolver, and it calls either ResolveBreakpoint
/// or ResolveBreakpointInModules to tell it to look for new breakpoint locations.
//----------------------------------------------------------------------
