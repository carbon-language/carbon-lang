/// @class DynamicLoader DynamicLoader.h "lldb/Target/DynamicLoader.h"
/// @brief A plug-in interface definition class for dynamic loaders.
///
/// Dynamic loader plug-ins track image (shared library) loading and
/// unloading. The class is initialized given a live process that is
/// halted at its entry point or just after attaching.
///
/// Dynamic loader plug-ins can track the process by registering
/// callbacks using the:
/// Process::RegisterNotificationCallbacks (const Notifications&)
/// function.
///
/// Breakpoints can also be set in the process which can register
/// functions that get called using:
/// Process::BreakpointSetCallback (lldb::user_id_t, BreakpointHitCallback, void *).
/// These breakpoint callbacks return a boolean value that indicates if
/// the process should continue or halt and should return the global
/// setting for this using:
/// DynamicLoader::StopWhenImagesChange() const.
