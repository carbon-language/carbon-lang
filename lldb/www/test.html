          <div class="postcontent">
            <p>
              The LLDB test suite consists of Python scripts located under the
              <tt>test</tt> directory. Each script contains a number of test cases and is usually
              accompanied by a C (C++, ObjC, etc.) source file. Each test first compiles the
              source file and then uses LLDB to debug the resulting executable. The tests verify
              both the LLDB command line interface and the scripting API.
            </p>

            <p>
              The easiest way to run the LLDB test suite is to use the <tt>check-lldb</tt> build
              target. By default, the <tt>check-lldb</tt> target builds the test programs with
              the same compiler that was used to build LLDB. To build the tests with a different
              compiler, you can set the <tt>LLDB_TEST_COMPILER</tt> CMake variable. It is possible to
              customize the architecture of the test binaries and compiler used by appending -A
              and -C options respectively to the CMake variable <tt>LLDB_TEST_USER_ARGS</tt>. For
              example, to test LLDB against 32-bit binaries
              built with a custom version of clang, do:
            </p>
            <code>
              <br />&gt; cmake -DLLDB_TEST_ARGS="-A i386 -C /path/to/custom/clang" -G Ninja
              <br />&gt; ninja check-lldb
            </code>
            <p>Note that multiple -A and -C flags can be specified to <tt>LLDB_TEST_USER_ARGS</tt>.</p>
            <p>Note that on NetBSD you must export <tt>LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$PWD/lib</tt> in your environment. This is due to lack of
               the <tt>$ORIGIN</tt> linker feature.</p>
            <p>
              In addition to running all the LLDB test suites with the "check-lldb" CMake target above, it is possible to
              run individual LLDB tests. For example, to run the test cases defined in TestInferiorCrashing.py, run:
            </p>
            <code>
              <br />&gt; cd $lldb/test
              <br />&gt; python dotest.py --executable &lt;path-to-lldb&gt;  -p TestInferiorCrashing.py
            </code>
            <p>
              In addition to running a test by name, it is also possible to specify a directory path to <tt>dotest.py</tt>
              in order to run all the tests under that directory. For example, to run all the tests under the
              'functionalities/data-formatter' directory, run:
            </p>
            <code>
              <br />&gt; python dotest.py --executable &lt;path-to-lldb&gt; functionalities/data-formatter
            </code>
            <p>
              To dump additional information to <tt>stdout</tt> about how the test harness is driving LLDB, run
              <tt>dotest.py</tt> with the <tt>-t</tt> flag. Many more options that are available. To see a list of all of them, run:
            </p>
            <code>
              <br />&gt; python dotest.py -h
            </code>

            <p>
              The dotest.py script runs tests in parallel by default.
              To disable the parallel test running feature, use the
              <code>--no-multiprocess</code> flag. The number of
              concurrent tests is controlled by
              the <code>LLDB_TEST_THREADS</code> environment variable
              or the <code>--threads</code> command line parameter.
              The default value is the number of CPU cores on your
              system.
            </p>
            <p>
              The parallel test running feature will handle an
              additional <code>--test-subdir SUBDIR</code> arg.  When
              specified, SUBDIR is relative to the root test directory
              and will limit all parallel test running to that
              subdirectory's tree of tests.
            </p>
            <p>
              The parallel test runner will run all tests within a
              given directory serially, but will run multiple
              directories concurrently.  Thus, as a test writer, we
              provide serialized test run semantics within a
              directory.  Note child directories are considered
              entirely separate, so two child directories could be
              running in parallel with a parent directory.
            </p>

            <h3>Running the test-suite remotely</h3>

            <p>
              Running the test-suite remotely is similar to the process of running a local test
              suite, but there are two things to have in mind:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                You must have the <code>lldb-server</code> running on the remote system, ready to
                accept multiple connections. For more information on how to setup remote
                debugging see the <a href="remote.html">Remote debugging</a> page.
              </li>
              <li>
                You must tell the test-suite how to connect to the remote system. This is
                achieved using the <code>--platform-name</code>, <code>--platform-url</code> and
                <code>--platform-working-dir</code> parameters to <code>dotest.py</code>. These
                parameters correspond to the <code>platform select</code> and <code>platform
                connect</code> LLDB commands. You will usually also need to specify the compiler and
                architecture for the remote system.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              Currently, running the remote test suite is supported only with
              <code>dotest.py</code> (or <code>dosep.py</code> with a single thread), but we
              expect this issue to be addressed in the near future.
