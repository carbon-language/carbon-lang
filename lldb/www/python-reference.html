                    <p>The entire LLDB API is available as Python functions through a script bridging interface. 
                    This means the LLDB API's can be used directly from python either interactively or to build python apps that
                    provide debugger features.  </p>
                    <p>Additionally, Python can be used as a programmatic interface within the 
                    lldb command interpreter (we refer to this for brevity as the embedded interpreter).  Of course,
                    in this context it has full access to the LLDB API - with some additional conveniences we will 
                    call out in the FAQ.</p>

                    <p>The LLDB API is contained in a python module named <b>lldb</b>. Help is available through the standard python help and documentation. To get an overview of the <b>lldb</b> python module you can execute the following command:</p>
<code><pre><tt>(lldb) <b>script help(lldb)</b>
    Help on package lldb:

    NAME
        lldb - The lldb module contains the public APIs for Python binding.

    FILE
        /System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/LLDB.framework/Versions/A/Resources/Python/lldb/__init__.py

    DESCRIPTION
...
</tt></pre></code>
                    <p>You can also get help using a module class name. The full API that is exposed for that class will be displayed in a man page style window. Below we want to get help on the lldb.SBFrame class:</p>
<code><pre><tt>(lldb) <b>script help(lldb.SBFrame)</b>
    Help on class SBFrame in module lldb:

    class SBFrame(__builtin__.object)
     |  Represents one of the stack frames associated with a thread.
     |  SBThread contains SBFrame(s). For example (from test/lldbutil.py),
     |  
     |  def print_stacktrace(thread, string_buffer = False):
     |      '''Prints a simple stack trace of this thread.'''
     |  
...
</tt></pre></code>
                    <p>Or you can get help using any python object, here we use the <b>lldb.process</b> object which is a global variable in the <b>lldb</b> module which represents the currently selected process:</p>
<code><pre><tt>(lldb) <b>script help(lldb.process)</b>
    Help on SBProcess in module lldb object:

    class SBProcess(__builtin__.object)
     |  Represents the process associated with the target program.
     |  
     |  SBProcess supports thread iteration. For example (from test/lldbutil.py),
     |  
     |  # ==================================================
     |  # Utility functions related to Threads and Processes
     |  # ==================================================

                    <p>The embedded python interpreter can be accessed in a variety of ways from within LLDB. The
                    easiest way is to use the lldb command <b>script</b> with no arguments at the lldb command prompt:</p>
<code><pre><tt>(lldb) <strong>script</strong>
Python Interactive Interpreter. To exit, type 'quit()', 'exit()' or Ctrl-D.
>>> 2+3
5
>>> hex(12345)
'0x3039'
>>> 
</tt></pre></code>

                    <p>This drops you into the embedded python interpreter. When running under the <b>script</b> command, 
                       lldb sets some convenience variables that give you quick access to the currently selected entities that characterize
                       the program and debugger state.  In each case, if there is no currently selected entity of the appropriate
                       type, the variable's <b>IsValid</b> method will return false. These variables are:</p>

                    <p>While extremely convenient, these variables have a couple caveats that you should be aware of.
                       First of all, they hold the values
                       of the selected objects on entry to the embedded interpreter.  They do not update as you use the LLDB
                       API's to change, for example, the currently selected stack frame or thread.  
                     <p>Moreover, they are only defined and meaningful while in the interactive Python interpreter.
                       There is no guarantee on their value in any other situation, hence you should not use them when defining
                       Python formatters, breakpoint scripts and commands (or any other Python extension point that LLDB provides).
                       As a rationale for such behavior, consider that lldb can
                       run in a multithreaded environment, and another thread might call the "script" command, changing the value out
                       from under you.</p>

                    <p>To get started with these objects and LLDB scripting, please note that almost 
                       all of the <b>lldb</b> Python objects are able to briefly describe themselves when you pass them 
                       to the Python <b>print</b> function:
<code><pre><tt>(lldb) <b>script</b>
Python Interactive Interpreter. To exit, type 'quit()', 'exit()' or Ctrl-D.
>>> <strong>print lldb.debugger</strong>
Debugger (instance: "debugger_1", id: 1)

>>> <strong>print lldb.process</strong>

			<h1 class ="postheader">Running a Python script when a breakpoint gets hit</h1>
			<div class="postcontent">

                <p>One very powerful use of the lldb Python API is to have a python script run when a breakpoint gets hit. Adding python
                    scripts to breakpoints provides a way to create complex breakpoint
                    conditions and also allows for smart logging and data gathering.</p>
                <p>When your process hits a breakpoint to which you have attached some python code, the code is executed as the
                   body of a function which takes three arguments:</p>
                    <p>
<code><pre><tt>def breakpoint_function_wrapper(<b>frame</b>, <b>bp_loc</b>, <b>dict</b>):

             <p>Optionally, a Python breakpoint command can return a value. Returning False tells LLDB that you do not want to stop at the breakpoint.
                Any other return value (including None or leaving out the return statement altogether) is akin to telling LLDB to actually stop at the breakpoint.
                This can be useful in situations where a breakpoint only needs to stop the process when certain conditions are met, and you do not want to inspect the
                program state manually at every stop and then continue.
             <p>An example will show how simple it is to write some python code and attach it to a breakpoint. 
                The following example will allow you to track the order in which the functions in a given shared library 
                are first executed during one run of your program.  This is a simple method to gather an order file which
                can be used to optimize function placement within a binary for execution locality.</p>
             <p>We do this by setting a regular expression breakpoint
                that will match every function in the shared library. The regular expression '.' will match
                any string that has at least one character in it, so we will use that. 
                This will result in one <b>lldb.SBBreakpoint</b> object
                that contains an <b>lldb.SBBreakpointLocation</b> object for each function. As the breakpoint gets
                hit, we use a counter to track the order in which the function at this particular breakpoint location got hit.
                Since our code is passed the location that was hit, we can get the name of the function from the location,
                disable the location so we won't count this function again; then log some info and continue the process.</p>
             <p>Note we also have to initialize our counter, which we do with the simple one-line version of the <b>script</b>
                command.
             <p>Here is the code:

<code><pre><tt>(lldb) <strong>breakpoint set --func-regex=. --shlib=libfoo.dylib</strong>
Breakpoint created: 1: regex = '.', module = libfoo.dylib, locations = 223
(lldb) <strong>script counter = 0</strong>
(lldb) <strong>breakpoint command add --script-type python 1</strong>
Enter your Python command(s). Type 'DONE' to end.
> <font color=green># Increment our counter.  Since we are in a function, this must be a global python variable</font>
> <strong>global counter</strong> 
> <strong>counter += 1</strong>
> <font color=green># Get the name of the function</font>
> <strong>name = frame.GetFunctionName()</strong>
> <font color=green># Print the order and the function name</font>
> <strong>print '[%i] %s' % (counter, name)</strong>
> <font color=green># Disable the current breakpoint location so it doesn't get hit again</font>
> <strong>bp_loc.SetEnabled(False)</strong>
> <font color=green># No need to stop here</font>
> <strong>return False</strong>
> <strong>DONE</strong>
</tt></pre></code>
            <p>The <b>breakpoint command add</b> command above attaches a python script to breakpoint 1.
            To remove the breakpoint command:
            <p><code>(lldb) <strong>breakpoint command delete 1</strong></code>

                <p>Python functions can be used to create new LLDB command interpreter commands, which will work
                   like all the natively defined lldb commands. This provides a very flexible and easy way to extend LLDB to meet your
                    debugging requirements. </p>
                <p>To write a python function that implements a new LDB command define the function to take four arguments as follows:</p>
                        
        <code><pre><tt>def command_function(<b>debugger</b>, <b>command</b>, <b>result</b>, <b>internal_dict</b>):
          <font color=green># Your code goes here</font>
        </tt></pre></code>

		Optionally, you can also provide a Python docstring, and LLDB will use it when providing help for your command, as in:
        <code><pre><tt>def command_function(<b>debugger</b>, <b>command</b>, <b>result</b>, <b>internal_dict</b>):
          <font color=green>"""This command takes a lot of options and does many fancy things"""</font>    
          <font color=green># Your code goes here</font>
        </tt></pre></code>

        <p><table class="stats" width="620" cellspacing="0">
        <tr>
            <td class="hed" width="10%">Argument</td>

        </tr>

                The current debugger object.
            </td>

            </td>
            <td class="content">
                A python string containing all arguments for your command. If you need to chop up the arguments
                try using the <b>shlex</b> module's <code>shlex.split(command)</code> to properly extract the
                arguments.
            </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>

                <b>lldb.SBCommandReturnObject</b>
            </td>
            <td class="content">
                A return object which encapsulates success/failure information for the command and output text
                that needs to be printed as a result of the command. The plain Python "print" command also works but
                text won't go in the result by default (it is useful as a temporary logging facility).
            </td>

            <td class="content">
                <b>python dict object</b>
            </td>
            <td class="content">
                The dictionary for the current embedded script session which contains all variables 
                and functions.
            </td>
        </tr>
        </table>
        <p>As a convenience, you can treat the result object as a Python file object, and say
        <code><pre><tt>print >>result, "my command does lots of cool stuff"</tt></pre></code>
        SBCommandReturnObject and SBStream
        both support this file-like behavior by providing write() and flush() calls at the Python layer.</p>
        <p>One other handy convenience when defining lldb command-line commands is the command
          <b>command script import</b> which will import a module specified by file path - so you
          don't have to change your PYTHONPATH for temporary scripts.  It also has another convenience
          that if your new script module has a function of the form:</p>

<code><pre><tt>def __lldb_init_module(<b>debugger</b>, <b>internal_dict</b>):
    <font color=green># Command Initialization code goes here</font>
</tt></pre></code>

        <p>where <b>debugger</b> and <b>internal_dict</b> are as above, that function will get run when the module is loaded
           allowing you to add whatever commands you want into the current debugger. Note that
           this function will only be run when using the LLDB comand <b>command script import</b>,
           it will not get run if anyone imports your module from another module. 
           If you want to always run code when your module is loaded from LLDB
           <u>or</u> when loaded via an <b>import</b> statement in python code
           you can test the <b>lldb.debugger</b> object, since you imported the
           <lldb> module at the top of the python <b>ls.py</b> module. This test
           must be in code that isn't contained inside of any function or class,
           just like the standard test for <b>__main__</b> like all python modules
           usally do. Sample code would look like:

<code><pre><tt>if __name__ == '__main__':
    <font color=green># Create a new debugger instance in your module if your module 
    # can be run from the command line. When we run a script from
    # the command line, we won't have any debugger object in
    # lldb.debugger, so we can just create it if it will be needed</font>
    lldb.debugger = lldb.SBDebugger.Create()
elif lldb.debugger:
    <font color=green># Module is being run inside the LLDB interpreter</font>
    lldb.debugger.HandleCommand('command script add -f ls.ls ls')
    print 'The "ls" python command has been installed and is ready for use.'
</tt></pre></code>
        <p>Now we can create a module called <b>ls.py</b> in the file <b>~/ls.py</b> that will implement a function that
           can be used by LLDB's python command code:</p>
        
<code><pre><tt><font color=green>#!/usr/bin/python</font>

import lldb
import commands
import optparse
import shlex

def ls(debugger, command, result, internal_dict):
    print >>result, (commands.getoutput('/bin/ls %s' % command))

<font color=green># And the initialization code to add your commands </font>
def __lldb_init_module(debugger, internal_dict):
    debugger.HandleCommand('command script add -f ls.ls ls')
    print 'The "ls" python command has been installed and is ready for use.'
</tt></pre></code>
        <p>Now we can load the module into LLDB and use it</p>
<code><pre><tt>% lldb
(lldb) <strong>command script import ~/ls.py</strong>
The "ls" python command has been installed and is ready for use.
(lldb) <strong>ls -l /tmp/</strong>

</tt></pre></code>
        <p>A more interesting template has been created in the source repository that can help you to create
            lldb command quickly:</p>
        <a href="http://llvm.org/svn/llvm-project/lldb/trunk/examples/python/cmdtemplate.py">cmdtemplate.py</a>
		<p>
		A commonly required facility is being able to create a command that does some token substitution, and then runs a different debugger command
		(usually, it po'es the result of an expression evaluated on its argument). For instance, given the following program:
		<code><pre><tt>
#import &lt;Foundation/Foundation.h&gt;
NSString*
ModifyString(NSString* src)
{
	return [src stringByAppendingString:@"foobar"];
}

int main()
{
	NSString* aString = @"Hello world";
	NSString* anotherString = @"Let's be friends";
	return 1;
}
		</tt></pre></code>
		you may want a pofoo X command, that equates po [ModifyString(X) capitalizedString].
		The following debugger interaction shows how to achieve that goal:
		<code><pre><tt>
(lldb) <b>script</b>
Python Interactive Interpreter. To exit, type 'quit()', 'exit()' or Ctrl-D.
>>> <b>def pofoo_funct(debugger, command, result, internal_dict):</b>
...	<b>cmd = "po [ModifyString(" + command + ") capitalizedString]"</b>
...	<b>lldb.debugger.HandleCommand(cmd)</b>
... 
>>> ^D
(lldb) <b>command script add pofoo -f pofoo_funct</b>
(lldb) <b>pofoo aString</b>
$1 = 0x000000010010aa00 Hello Worldfoobar
(lldb) <b>pofoo anotherString</b>
$2 = 0x000000010010aba0 Let's Be Friendsfoobar</tt></pre></code>

			<h1 class ="postheader">Using the lldb.py module in python</h1>
			<div class="postcontent">

                <p>LLDB has all of its core code build into a shared library which gets
                    used by the <b>lldb</b> command line application. On Mac OS X this
                    shared library is a framework: <b>LLDB.framework</b> and on other
                    unix variants the program is a shared library: <b>lldb.so</b>. LLDB also
                    provides an lldb.py module that contains the bindings from LLDB into Python.
                    To use the 
                    <b>LLDB.framework</b> to create your own stand-alone python programs, you will
                    need to tell python where to look in order to find this module. This
                    is done by setting the <b>PYTHONPATH</b> environment variable, adding
                    a path to the directory that contains the <b>lldb.py</b> python module.  On 
                    Mac OS X, this is contained inside the LLDB.framework, so you would do:
                    
                    <p>For csh and tcsh:</p>
                    <p><code>% <b>setenv PYTHONPATH /Developer/Library/PrivateFrameworks/LLDB.framework/Resources/Python</b></code></p>
                    <p>For sh and bash:
                    <p><code>% <b>export PYTHONPATH=/Developer/Library/PrivateFrameworks/LLDB.framework/Resources/Python</b></code></p>
                    
                    <p> Alternately, you can append the LLDB Python directory to the <b>sys.path</b> list directly in
                    your Python code before importing the lldb module.</p>

                    <p>
                        Now your python scripts are ready to import the lldb module. Below is a
                        python script that will launch a program from the current working directory
                        called "a.out", set a breakpoint at "main", and then run and hit the breakpoint,
                        and print the process, thread and frame objects if the process stopped:
                        
                    </p>
