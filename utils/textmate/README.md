This directory contains a [TextMate](https://macromates.com/) bundle which can
be used in various editors such as TextMate, Atom, or the IntelliJ family for
syntax highlighting of Carbon source files.

If you are using TextMate, see the documentation on
[how to install TextMate bundles](https://macromates.com/manual/en/bundles#getting_more_bundles).
Clone the repository with Git and symlink/copy the `utils/textmate` directory to
any of the paths TextMate will search through (you can find these paths in the
TextMate documentation above).

If you are using IntelliJ or a IntelliJ Platform product, you can find
documentation on
[how to install TextMate bundles in IntelliJ](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/textmate.html#import-textmate-bundles).
Clone the repository with Git and open the `utils/textmate` directory inside the
IntelliJ TextMate Bundle window.

If you are using Atom, you can convert the bundle to an Atom-compatible one. See
[the Atom documentation on how to do that.](https://flight-manual.atom.io/hacking-atom/sections/converting-from-textmate/)

For other editors that support TextMate bundles you can consult your editors
documentation to see how to use the bundle.
