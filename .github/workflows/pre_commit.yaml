      # We want to automatically create github suggestions for pre-commit file
      # changes for a pull request. But `pull_request` actions never have write
      # permissions to the repository, so we create the suggestions in a separate
      # privileged `workflow_run` action in pre_commit_suggestions.yaml. Here,
      # we upload the diffs and event configuration to an artifact for use by
      # that action.
