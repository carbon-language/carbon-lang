## Problem

Since types are values, types themselves have types. So what can we say about
the type of something like `Int32`?

## Background

This proposal builds on and assumes
[Generics proposal PR 36](https://github.com/carbon-language/carbon-lang/pull/36).

## Proposal

The type of `Int32` must be a unit type. Details of the reasoning are provided
in `docs/design/generics/type_types_are_unit.md`.
