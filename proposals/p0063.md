## Problem

Carbon is currently private, and should have a clear plan for going public.

## Background

Some of this is explained to people when they're asked if they'd like to
contribute to Carbon; the purpose of this proposal is to provide documentation.

## Proposal

See /docs/project/going_public.md.

## Alternatives considered

We have also considered going public immediately. We believe the noted criteria
are important to address before proceeding.
