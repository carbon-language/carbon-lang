## Abstract

-   Require namespace members be declared in the same name scope as the
    namespace is declared.
-   Allow binding patterns to directly declare names in namespaces.
-   Disallow using different namespaces in the same binding pattern.

## Problem

While the trivial case of `var NS.a` seems to be supported as a consequence of
proposal
[#107: Code and name organization](https://github.com/carbon-language/carbon-lang/pull/107),
there are a couple syntactic options when binding multiple names.

Also, there's no clear decision around code such as:

```carbon
namespace NS;
class ClassT {
  // Is this a class member accessed through `NS`, or a file scope member inside
  // `NS`? What is its lifetime?
  var NS.a = 0;
}
```

This proposal mainly aims to remove these ambiguities.

## Background

Namespaces are covered in
[code and name organization](/docs/design/code_and_name_organization/#namespaces).
Binding patterns are covered in
[pattern matching](/docs/design/pattern_matching.md#binding-patterns).

There's some discussion of `var` in
[values, variables, and pointers](/docs/design/values.md), but it's specific to
locals. That doesn't address other use cases, such as globals or member
variables.

## Proposal

When used to declare names in binding patterns, as in `var` or `let`, all names
must be in the same namespace. Declaring members of a namespace inside of an
unrelated scope is invalid.

See the changes to
[code and name organization](/docs/design/code_and_name_organization/#namespaces)
for reference.

## Rationale

-   [Performance-critical software](/docs/project/goals.md#performance-critical-software)

    -   Only allowing binding patterns to declare variables in the same
        namespace allows for a guarantee that the memory can be sequentially
        allocated. This allows for copy elision on initializers with function
        calls.

-   [Code that is easy to read, understand, and write](/docs/project/goals.md#code-that-is-easy-to-read-understand-and-write)

    -   Requiring that declarations of multiple names use `NS.a` syntax is
        consistent with the single variable case.
    -   Requiring namespace members be declared while in the same name scope as
        the namespace itself makes lifetimes clearer.

## Alternatives considered

### Allow prefixing a tuple binding pattern with a namespace

We could use the namespace to prefix the binding tuple. For example:

```carbon
var NS.(a: i32, b: i32) = (3, 4);
```

It's rare that we would have a single statement declare multiple names. As a
consequence, the separation of the namespace qualifier from the declared
identifier might end up unique to this syntax. In that context, we prefer `NS.a`
for consistency with other cases, such as `class NS.class`.

### Allow binding patterns to declare names in multiple namespaces

We could allow binding patterns to declare names in multiple namespaces. For
example:

```carbon
namespace NS;
var (NS.a: i32, b: i32) = InitData();
```

Mixing namespaces could be confusing: for example, `b` could be misunderstood to
be declared in `NS`. We lack data that would demonstrate benefits to offset
that.

We disallow mixing namespaces in a single declaration for simplicity.

### Allow declaring names in namespaces not owned by the current scope

We could allow declaring names in namespaces not owned by the current scope. For
example:

```carbon
namespace NS;
class ClassT {
  var NS.val: i32;

  class NS.ChildT {}
}
```

Here, `package.NS.val` would be a global, but `ClassT.NS.val` looks more like an
instance member. It's also unclear whether `ClassT.NS.val` (or
`instance.NS.val`) could be used to reference the produced variable, since `NS`
is not inside `ClassT`'s name scope. These problems extend to non-binding
declarations such as `NS.ChildT`, too.

Disallowing using namespaces to cross name scopes is consistent with rules that
generally prevent declaring names in other name scopes, such as:

```carbon
class A {
    class B {
        // `C` must be declared directly inside `A`.
        class A.C;
    }
}

// `D` must be declared within `A`, even if separately defined.
class A.D {}
```

Both the `namespace` declaration and names declared within the `namespace` must
be written in the same name scope. This avoids name lookup ambiguities, and
builds consistency in name scope boundaries across declarations.

### Disallow declaring namespaces other than the file scope

We could disallow declaring namespaces in scopes other than the file scope.
Combined with requiring members of namespaces to only be declared at the file
scope, this would prevent their use in other contexts.

This would be consistent with C++. However, we believe the current design
doesn't actively interfere with Carbon, and it could prove useful in some
situations. For example, perhaps a complex class would find a member namespace
useful:

```carbon
class Complex {
   namespace OptionSet1;
   class OptionSet1.MemberClassA;
   class OptionSet1.MemberClassB;

   namespace OptionSet2;
   class OptionSet2.MemberClassC;
   class OptionSet2.MemberClassD;
}
```

This would be easy to work around if disallowed (for example, combine names for
`OptionSet1MemberClassA`). This is both good and bad; disallowing it would be
cheap, but it may mask friction from not providing the feature.

Although we're not sure how useful this will prove to be, we will allow the
syntax and may reevaluate in the future.
