## Problem

We would like a set of documents explaining the principles by which we judge
proposed changes to the language. This is to achieve many goals:

- Make sure we agree on the approach we are taking.
- Clearly communicate expectations to contributors.
- Encourage us to solve problems in a consistent way.
- Provide a yardstick for measuring different proposals.

While there are many such documents we would like, this specific proposal
starts with a single one on how we would like to tackle "generics".

## Background

The question of what a generics feature would look like in Carbon has been
an ongoing discussion. This document was formed to codify some of the different
possible goals that we thought were worth looking at.

## Proposal

See the generics principles document.

## Alternatives considered

### Further polish

This doc is a starting point, and aims to be a good starting point rather
than definitive. I am aiming for velocity over perfection here, so the main
alternative is to resolve more questions before trying to publish this.
