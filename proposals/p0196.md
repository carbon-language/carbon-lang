## Problem

Carbon needs to have a clear and consistent strategy for approaching the
problems of language-level safety. These problems have been persistent and
growing sources of both bugs and security vulnerabilities in C and C++ software.
Failure to effectively and carefully address safety concerns is likely to
undermine any hope of Carbon being a successful path forward for today's C++
users.

## Background

-   [Fearless Security: Memory Safety](https://hacks.mozilla.org/2019/01/fearless-security-memory-safety/)
-   [A proactive approach to more secure code](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/07/16/a-proactive-approach-to-more-secure-code/)
-   [Chromium memory safety](https://www.chromium.org/Home/chromium-security/memory-safety)
-   [MemSafe](https://doi.org/10.1002/spe.2105)
    -   Notably introduces the terms "_spatial_" and "_temporal_" safety.

## Proposal

We propose a safety strategy for Carbon that aims for incrementally increasing
the compile-time proven safety while allowing for dynamic checks to cover what
remains. It also prioritizes dynamic safety checks that are amenable to being
optimized away or being manually disabled for performance-critical use cases
where the added dynamic protections are not a viable trade-off.
