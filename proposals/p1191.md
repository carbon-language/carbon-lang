## Problem

Carbon needs operations for working with bit representations of values.

## Background

C++ provides four bitwise operations for Boolean algebra: complement (`~`), and
(`&`), or (`|`), and xor (`^`). These are all useful in bit-maipulation code
(although `^` is used substantially less than the others). In addition, C++
provides two bit-shift operators `<<` and `>>` that can perform three different
operations: left shift, arithmetic right shift, and logical right shift. The
meaning of `>>` is determined by the signedness of the first operand.

C and Swift use the same set of operators as C++. Rust uses most of the same
operators, but uses `!` instead of `~` for complement, unifying it with the
logical not operator, which is spelled `not` in Carbon and as `!` in Rust and
C++. Go uses most of the same operators as C++, but uses unary prefix `^`
instead of `~` for complement, mirroring binary `^` for xor.

In addition to the operators provided by C and C++, bit-rotate operators are
present in some languages, and a short notation for them may be convenient.
Finally, there are other non-degenerate binary Boolean operations with no common
operator symbol:

-   The "implies" operator (equivalent to `~a | b`).
-   The "implied by" operator (equivalent to `a | ~b`).
-   The complement of each of the other operators (NAND, NOR, XNOR, "does not
    imply", "is not implied by").

### Overflow in shift operators

The behavior of shift operators in C++ had a turbulent past. The behavior of
shift operators has always been undefined if the right operand is out of range
-- not between zero inclusive and the bit-width of the left operator exclusive
-- but other restrictions have varied:

-   Unsigned left shift has never had any restrictions on the first operand.
-   For signed left shift:
    -   In C++98, the result was fully unspecified.
    -   In C++11, the result was specified only if the first operand was
        non-negative and the result fit into the destination type -- that is, if
        no 1 bit is shifted into the sign bit.
    -   In C++14, the result was specified only if the first operand was
        non-negative and the result fit into the unsigned type corresponding to
        the destination type -- that is, if no 1 bit is shifted out of the sign
        bit.
    -   In C++20 onwards, there are no restrictions beyond a range restriction
        on the right operand, and the result is otherwise always specified, even
        if the left operand is negative.
-   Unsigned right shift has never had any restrictions on the first operand.
-   For signed right shift:
    -   In C++17 and earlier, if the left operand is negative, the result is
        implementation-defined.
    -   In C++20 onwards, the result is always specified, even if the left
        operand is negative.

There is a clear trend towards defining more cases, following two's complement
rules.

## Proposal

Use the same operator set as C++, but replace `~` with unary prefix `^`.

Define the behavior for all cases of `<<` and `>>` except where the right
operand is either negative or is greater than or equal to the bit-width of the
left operand.

## Details

See changes to the design, and in particular
[the new section on bitwise and shift operators](/docs/design/expressions/bitwise.md).

## Rationale

-   [Performance-critical software](/docs/project/goals.md#performance-critical-software)
    -   Bit operations are important low-level primitives. Providing operators
        for them is important in order to allow low-level high-performance code
        to be written elegantly in Carbon.
    -   By not defining semantics for `<<` and `>>` when the right-hand operand
        is out of range, we can directly use hardware instructions for these
        operations whose behavior in these cases vary between architectures.
-   [Code that is easy to read, understand, and write](/docs/project/goals.md#code-that-is-easy-to-read-understand-and-write)
    -   Using operator notation rather than function call notation for bitwise
        operators improves readability in code making heavy use of these
        operations.
-   [Practical safety and testing mechanisms](/docs/project/goals.md#practical-safety-and-testing-mechanisms)
    -   Carbon follows C++ in treating `<<` and `>>` as programming errors when
        the right hand operand is out of range, but Carbon guarantees that such
        errors will not directly result in unbounded misbehavior in hardened
        builds.
-   [Modern OS platforms, hardware architectures, and environments](/docs/project/goals.md#modern-os-platforms-hardware-architectures-and-environments)
    -   All hardware architectures we care to support are natively two's
        complement architectures, and that assumption allows us to define the
        semantics of shift operators in the way that makes the most sense for
        such architectures.
    -   Our bitwise operations make no assumptions about the endianness of the
        hardware architecture, although the shift operators make the most sense
        on a little-endian or big-endian architecture, which are the only
        endiannesses we expect to see in modern hardware platforms.
-   [Interoperability with and migration from existing C++ code](/docs/project/goals.md#interoperability-with-and-migration-from-existing-c-code)
    -   The same set of operators is provided as in C++, making it easy for
        programmers and programs to migrate, with the exception that the `~`
        operator is mechanically replaced with `^`. This change is expected to
        be easy for programmers to accommodate, especially given that Rust's
        choice to replace `~` with `!` does not seem to be a source of sustained
        complaints.
    -   The extensiblity support reflects the full scope of operator overloading
        in C++, permitting separate overloading of each of the bitwise operators
        with custom return types. This should allow smooth interoperability with
        C++ overloaded operators.

## Alternatives considered

### Use different symbols for bitwise operators

The operator syntax for bitwise operators was decided in
[#545](https://github.com/carbon-language/carbon-lang/issues/545). Some of the
specific alternatives considered are discussed below.

#### Use a multi-character spelling

We considered using various multi-character spellings for the bitwise and, or,
xor, and complement operators:

-   `&:`, `|:`, `^:`, `~:`
-   `.&.`, `.|.`, `.^.`, `.~.`
-   `.*.`, `.+.`, `.!=.`, `.!.`
-   `/\`, `\/`, `(+)`, `-|`
-   `bitand`, `bitor`, `bitxor`, `compl`

The advantage of switching to such a set of operators is that this would free up
the single-character `&`, `|`, `^`, and `~` tokens for other uses that may occur
more frequently in Carbon programs. We have some candidate uses for these
operators already:

-   `&` is used for combining interfaces and as a unary address-of operator.
-   `|` may be useful for sum types, for alternatives in patterns, or as another
    kind of bracket as in
    [Ruby's lambda notation](https://ruby-doc.org/docs/ruby-doc-bundle/Manual/man-1.4/syntax.html#iter).
-   `~` may be useful as a destructive move notation.
-   `^` may be useful as a postfix pointer dereference operator.

However, moving substantially away from the C++ operator set comes with a set of
concerns:

-   There are strong established expectations and intuitions about these
    operators and their spellings among C++ practitioners.
-   In some of the code that uses these operators, they are used a lot, and a
    more cumbersome operator may consequently cause an outsized detriment on
    readability.
-   These operations are used particularly in the area of low-level,
    high-performance code, which is an area for which we want Carbon to be
    especially appealing. Using short operators for these operations
    demonstrates our commitment to providing good support for such code.
-   Even if we didn't use these operators as bit operators, we would still want
    to exercise caution when using them for some other purpose to avoid
    surprising C++ developers.

#### Don't provide an xor operator

We considered omitting the `^` operator, providing this functionality in some
other way, such as a named function or an `xor` keyword, while keeping the `&`
and `|` symbols for bitwise operations. We could take a similar approach for the
complement operation, such as by using a `compl` keyword. The primary motivation
was to avoid spending two precious operator characters on relatively uncommon
operations. However, we did not want to apply the same change to `&` and `|`,
and it seemed important to maintain consistency between the three binary bitwise
operators from C++.

Using `^` for both operations provides some of the benefits here, allowing us to
reclaim `~`, without introducing the inconsistency that would result from using
keywords.

#### Use `~`, or some other symbol, for complement

We could follow C++ and use `~` as the complement operator. However, using `~`
for this purpose spends a precious operator character on a relatively uncommon
operation, and `~` is often visually confusible with `-`, creating the potential
for readability problems. Also, in C++, `~` is overloaded to also refer to
destruction, and we may want to use the same notation for destruction or
destructive move semantics in Carbon.

We found `^` to be a satisfying alternative with a good rationale and mnemonic:
`^` is a bit-flipping operator -- `a ^ b` flips the bits in `a` that are
specified in `b` -- and complement is an operator that flips _all_ the bits.
`^a` is equivalent to `a ^ n`, where `n` is the all-one-bits value in the type
of `a`.

We also considered using `!` for complement, like Rust does. Unlike in Rust,
this would not be a generalization of `!` on `bool`, because we use `not` for
`bool` negation, and repurposing `!` in this way compared to C++ seemed
confusing.

### Provide different operators for arithmetic and logical shifts

We could provide different operators for arithmetic right shift and logical
right shift. This might allow programmers to better express their intent.
However, it seems unnecessary, as using the type of the left operand is a
strategy that doesn't appear to have caused significant problems in practice in
the languages that have followed it.

Basing the kind of shift on the signedness of the left operand also follows from
viewing a negative number as having an infinite number of leading 1 bits, which
is the underlying mathematical model behind the two's complement representation.

### Provide rotate operators

We could provide bitwise rotation operators. However, there doesn't seem to be a
sufficient need to justify adding another operator symbol for this purpose.

### Support shifting a constant by a variable

We considered various ways to support

```
var a: i32 = ...;
var b: i32 = 1 << a;
var c: i32 = 1234 >> a;
```

with no explicit type specified for the first operand of a bit-shift operator.
We considered the following options:

-   Use the type of the second operand as the result type. This would be
    surprising, because the type of the second operand doesn't otherwise
    influence the result type of a built-in bit-shift operator.
-   Use some suitable integer type that can fit the first operand. However, this
    is unlikely to do the right thing for a left-shift, and will frequently pick
    either a type that's too large, resulting in the program being rejected due
    to narrowing, or a type that's too small, resulting in a program that has
    undefined behavior due to the second operand being too large. We could apply
    this approach only for right shifts, but it was deemed too inconsistent to
    use different rules for left and right shifts.
-   We could find a way to defer picking the type in which the operation is
    performed until later. For example, we could treat `1 << a` as a value of a
    new type that carries its left-hand operand as a type parameter and its
    right-hand operand as runtime state, and allow that type to be converted in
    the same way as its integer constant. However, this would introduce
    substantial complexity, and would allow implicit conversions that notionally
    overflow, such as would happen in the above example when `a` is greater
    than 32.

In the absence of a good approach, we disallow such conversions for now. The
above example can be written as:

```
var a: i32 = ...;
var b: i32 = (1 as i32) << a;
var c: i32 = (1234 as i32) >> a;
```

### Converting complements to unsigned types

We view an integer constant has having infinitely many high-order sign bits
followed by some number of lower-order value bits. As a consequence, the
complement of a positive integer constant is negative. As a result, some
important forms of initialization use a negative integer constant initializer
for an unsigned type:

```
// Initializer here is the integer value -8.
var mask: u32 = ^7;
```

We considered some options for handling this:

-   We could allow negative integer constants to convert to unsigned types if
    doing so only discards sign bits. This violates the "semantics-preserving"
    rule for implicit conversions.
-   We could change our model of integer constants to distinguish between
    "masks" -- numbers with infinitely many 1 bits preceding the value bits that
    are nonetheless not considered to be negative. This was considered to
    introduce too much complexity.
-   We could allow conversions to unsigned types from signed types and negative
    constants in general, or at least in cases where the signed operand is no
    wider than the unsigned type, and perform wrapping. The latter option seems
    plausible, but we don't have sufficient motivation for it, and were worried
    about a risk of bugs from allowing an implicit conversion at runtime that
    converts a negative value to an unsigned type.
-   We could reject such initializations, with an explicit conversion required
    to convert such values to unsigned types. This seems to present unacceptable
    ergonomics for code performing bit-manipulation.

On balance, our preferred option was to permit implicit conversions from
negative literals to unsigned types so long as we only discard sign bits.
