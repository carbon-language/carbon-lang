## Problem

[Carbon's goals](/docs/project/goals.md) include "Interoperability with and
migration from existing C++ code". This proposal aims to address what the
interoperability portion of that goal will look like.

## Background

This proposal assumes several other proposals, which will need to be addressed.
They are outlined here to clarify that, while the interoperability structure may
assume design decisions, it's not intended to _make_ these decisions; they will
require more discussion.

- Carbon will provide a form of
  [generic programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generic_programming) that
  we will refer to as "generics".
  - Generics will make implementation trade-offs consistent with Carbon's goals.
- Carbon will not provide a direct `int` equivalent built-in, particularly with
  variable size based on the target platform.
  - Instead, all integer types will be explicitly sized, e.g., `Int32`.
  - Carbon will have integer wrapping behaviors that diverge from C++.
- For inheritance-like behavior, Carbon will provide:
  - Interfaces in the form of APIs with no concrete methods.
  - Mix-ins as a way to reuse implementations.
  - **Not** C++-style inheritance, which could be considered to _combine_ these
    concepts.
- Carbon will provide "slices" of arrays.

## Proposal

See [the design](/docs/design/interoperability/README.md) for the proposal.
