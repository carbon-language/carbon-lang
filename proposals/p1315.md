## Problem

Open, transparent, and public development is often the best way to build a
developer community. Long-term evolution of Carbon behind closed doors does not
align with our core principles.

While early exploration with a limited group of participants has been effective
at bootstrapping, a primary goal for the Carbon experiment is to establish
whether there will be **broad industry interest and participation** in this
direction. We expect this kind of interest and participation to ultimately
result in widespread adoption if the technical components of the experiment
succeed. We both want to see how the industry reacts to Carbon and think that
reaction will be much more positive if the industry can actively participate and
help shape the language.

## Background

Historically, Carbon has followed a "quiet" development model. While developed
on GitHub using an open source process, the project was not publicly visible or
discussed outside the invited set of early participants.

Carbon developed an initial set of criteria that we expected to signal the
correct time for the project to become public:

-   Broader field experience required
-   Sustained interest from multiple organizations and individuals
-   A prototype implementation
-   A demonstration of potential
-   Learning material
-   Prepared for broader contributions and feedback
-   Prepared for a launch event

See the removed `going_public.md` document in this
[proposal](https://github.com/carbon-language/carbon-lang/pull/1315) for the
full historical criteria and analysis.

## Proposal

We should make the Carbon experiment public as soon as reasonably possible,
specifically at the upcoming [C++ North](https://cppnorth.ca) conference.

Many of the criteria outlined previously have not yet been met, and this
proposal specifically suggests shifting Carbon to be public without waiting for
them. Instead, we should make Carbon public largely as it is today. We should be
open and transparent about the current status. We should frame this as making a
_nascent_ project public in order to _build it in the open_, rather than
suggesting it is "done" or "ready" even for evaluation.

### Why go public now?

There is no perfect time to shift the project public, it is a tradeoff. The
earlier we move the project to be public, the earlier we can gain more broad
feedback and participation from the industry. However, it comes at the cost of
introducing people to the project at an earlier stage with less material to help
them get started. We believe Carbon has crossed the point where this tradeoff
suggests sooner would be overall better for the project than later.

**The Carbon experiment has accomplished what it can** to explore industry
interest and participation with limited and targeted outreach to experts. We
have built the critical community and design process and framework to support an
open technical discussion. We have also developed the key language design ideas
sufficiently to show what Carbon would look like clearly and unambiguously. To
broaden or deepen the feedback, we will need frank and public discussion with
wider groups of users and stakeholders. We will need to iterate with a larger
community and a broader set of stakeholders.

**The needs of the C++ community remain unmet, and they are eager** and asking
for exactly Carbon's approach. The technical approach of Carbon directly
addresses concrete and current requests from influential C++ developers. These
needs are specifically not met by C or C++ as they exist or by Rust or other
options, and we have a strategic opportunity to help drive a solution in this
space.

A recent example on Twitter:

> Speaking as a C/C++ developer, when I write in C/C++, I am doing so due to
> ecosystem/practical/legacy code constraints I have no control over, which
> means that being given a superior choice makes no difference to me because I
> didn't get a chance to choose C/C++ to start with
>

A recent HackerNews discussion directly suggested essentially the direction we
are exploring:

> The permanent-ABI compatibility decision was effectively the death-knell for
> C++. Can't improve the standard library performance, making it effectively
> useless for the real world. Can't correct mistakes - the language and library
> warts grow and grow as the years pass by, making it impossible for beginners
> to pick up and learn the language.

Last but not least, **having the Carbon experiment will accelerate the industry
into thinking about more dramatic ways to improve C++**.

### Planned process for going public

Our planned process is anchored around a few key principles:

-   Replicate LLVM's open-source approach and strategy. This has proven broadly
    successful over many years.
-   Use existing events and spaces where possible to engage with the C++
    community and industry.
-   Emphasize that it's an experiment, not a finished product.
-   Leverage existing C++ ecosystems rather than creating new ecosystems from
    scratch.

We expect three phases to move things to be public:

-   Get technical components ready: demo, documentation, etc.
-   Do an incremental "road show" with experts, organizations, and WG21 in weeks
    leading up to an official public announcement to seed early awareness.
-   Announce and make everything public at C++North.

During the second phase, we plan to engage with the following individuals and
groups:

-   Industry partners already active in C++ evolution.
-   Influential experts, especially those actively driving C++ evolution and
    prominently writing blog posts or speaking on C++.
-   Community organizations like "#include".
-   Will specifically include inviting large portions of these groups to join
    community spaces to help engage and establish the community culture.

The third phase will be oriented around a keynote at C++North:

-   Introduce the audience to the motivation for Carbon and its goals.
-   Explain the project, community, and process.
-   Walk through the core language design so far, and touch on exciting future
    efforts.
-   Provide an extended Q&A to help kick off active discussions, ideally with as
    much of the current Carbon contributors on stage as possible.
-   Will open the GitHub project _read_ ACLs either right before or during the
    talk so that the audience can explore during the Q&A and afterward.
-   Will open the _contribution_ ACLs and Discord Chat at the _end_ so that the
    maximum team bandwidth is available to engage with folks as they begin
    discussing.

Public site and communications plan:

-   Specifically not planning on a website, blog, or other more "official"
    presence.
-   Planning to use a GitHub project and GitHub hosted markdown documentation.
-   This should anchor on Carbon being an experiment and attracting contributors
    and participants rather than users.
-   Work with existing C++ community blogs to post information about the project
    after announcement.

## Rationale

TODO: How does this proposal effectively advance Carbon's goals? Rather than
re-stating the full motivation, this should connect that motivation back to
Carbon's stated goals and principles. This may evolve during review. Use links

and/or to documents in [`/docs/project/principles`](/docs/project/principles).
