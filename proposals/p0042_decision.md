## Open questions

There were no open questions.

## Rationale

This proposal contains the right goals for the code review process in light of
our project goals, and the proposal is well-tailored to achieve them.
Specifically:

-   Ensure high quality of code, documentation, and other artifacts. We consider
    these all "code reviews" regardless of whether the final artifact is "code"
    in a technical sense.
-   Encourage broad participation and contribution to the community through code
    reviews.
-   Ensure code reviews are inclusive, respectful, and welcoming.
-   Have clear, discoverable, and mechanically enforced (where possible) rules
    for who can, who should, and who must review any particular change.

We want pre-commit rather than post-commit review, and we want all changes to go
through review. These guidelines are consistent with standard code review best
practice, including whatâ€™s described in the cited sources.
