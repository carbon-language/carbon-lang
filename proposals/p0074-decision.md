## Open questions

### Do we want to add the proposal to the core team meeting agenda when the deadline for comments is announced, or when the deadline is reached?

The core team is okay with available options, and treating this as a bikeshed
that can be resolved by review managers as part of doc changes.

## Rationale

- This directly supports our community goals: not everybody is in a position to
  respond to events with less than a day of latency, so longer lead times before
  deadlines will help enable them to participate.
  - Longer lead time makes it more likely that we'll get substantive comments.
- The answer to the open question doesn't strongly matter, and there is a
  preference for leaving it to the review managers' discretion rather than
  having the core team decide.
