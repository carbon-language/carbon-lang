## TODO: Initial proposal setup

> TIP: Run `./new_proposal.py "TITLE"` to do new proposal setup.

1. Copy this template to `new.md`, and create a commit.
2. Create a GitHub pull request, to get a pull request number.
    - Add the `proposal draft` label to the pull request.
3. Rename `new.md` to `/proposals/p####.md`, where `####` should be the pull
   request number.
4. Update the title of the proposal (the `TODO` on line 1).
5. Update the link to the pull request (the `####` on line 11).
6. Delete this section.

TODOs indicate where content should be updated for a proposal. See
[Carbon Governance and Evolution](/docs/project/evolution.md) for more details.

## Problem

TODO: What problem are you trying to solve? How important is that problem? Who
is impacted by it?

## Background

TODO: Is there any background that readers should consider to fully understand
this problem and your approach to solving it?

## Proposal

TODO: Briefly and at a high level, how do you propose to solve the problem? Why
will that in fact solve it?

## Details

TODO: Fully explain the details of the proposed solution.

## Rationale

TODO: How does this proposal effectively advance Carbon's goals? Rather than
re-stating the full motivation, this should connect that motivation back to
Carbon's stated goals and principles. This may evolve during review. Use links
to appropriate sections of [`/docs/project/goals.md`](/docs/project/goals.md),
and/or to documents in [`/docs/project/principles`](/docs/project/principles).
