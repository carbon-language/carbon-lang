## Problem

Carbon should ensure that all checked-in changes to the repository are properly
code reviewed, and that the process for code review is effective across a number
of dimensions:

- Ensure high quality of code, documentation, and other artifacts. We consider
  these all "code reviews" regardless of whether the final artefact is "code" in
  a technical sense.
- Encourage broad participation and contribution to the community through code
  reviews.
- Ensure code reviews are inclusive, respectful, and welcoming.
- Have clear, discoverable, and mechanically enforced (where possible) rules for
  who *can*, who *should*, and who *must* review any particular change.

## Background

General code review:
- Chapter 9 "Code Review" in the SWE book
  (_[Software Engineering at Google](https://www.amazon.com/Software-Engineering-Google-Lessons-Programming/dp/1492082791)_)
- [Respectful Code Reviews
  (Chromium)](https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/+/master/docs/cr_respect.md)
- [Compassionate--Yet Candid--Code Reviews
  (video)](https://youtu.be/Ea8EiIPZvh0)
- [The Standard of Code
  Review](https://google.github.io/eng-practices/review/reviewer/standard.html)
- [How We Do Code
  Review](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/appcenter/how-the-visual-studio-mobile-center-team-does-code-review/)
