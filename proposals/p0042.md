## Problem

Carbon should ensure that all checked-in changes to the repository are properly
code reviewed, and that the process for code review is effective across a number
of dimensions:

- Ensure high quality of code, documentation, and other artifacts. We consider
  these all "code reviews" regardless of whether the final artefact is "code" in
  a technical sense.
- Encourage broad participation and contribution to the community through code
  reviews.
- Ensure code reviews are inclusive, respectful, and welcoming.
- Have clear, discoverable, and mechanically enforced (where possible) rules for
  who *can*, who *should*, and who *must* review any particular change.
