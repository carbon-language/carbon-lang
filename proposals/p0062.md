## Problem

Interoperability with C++ is one of Carbon's
[goals](https://github.com/carbon-language/carbon-lang/blob/master/docs/project/goals.md),
but it can have many interpretations. There should be a document describing what
kinds of tradeoffs the Carbon project is and isn't willing to make for the sake
of interoperability.

## Proposal

We propose adding `docs/project/principles/principle-interoperability.md`.
See that doc for details.
