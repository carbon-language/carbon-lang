## Problem

The goal of this proposal is to establish naming conventions for:

-   Idiomatic Carbon code.
-   Carbon-provided features, including:
    -   Keywords, such as `fn` or `for`.
    -   Basic types, such as `i32` or `bool`.
    -   Complex types, such as `String`.

The reason for resolving this through proposal is to ensure we're headed in a
reasonably consistent path as we write early documentation and example code.

## Background

Naming conventions are an issue frequently addressed by style guides. A few
examples of language-provided guidelines are:

-   [Effective Go](https://golang.org/doc/effective_go#names)
-   [Python's PEP 8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/#naming-conventions)
    -   Note PEP 8 offers a list of
        [naming styles](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/#descriptive-naming-styles).
-   [Rust API Guidelines](https://rust-lang.github.io/api-guidelines/naming.html)
-   [Swift's API Design Guidelines](https://swift.org/documentation/api-design-guidelines/#general-conventions)

Issue
[#750 Naming conventions for Carbon-provided features](https://github.com/carbon-language/carbon-lang/issues/750)
discusses options further.

## Proposal

Only `UpperCamelCase` and `lower_snake_case` conventions will be used, in order
to minimize the variation in rules.

-   For idiomatic Carbon code:
    -   `UpperCamelCase` will be used when the identifier can be resolved to a
        specific value at compile-time.
    -   `lower_snake_case` will be used when the identifier's value won't be
        known until runtime, such as for variables.
        -   Private class members will have a suffix `_`.
-   For Carbon-provided features:
    -   Keywords will use `lower_snake_case`, but should typically be a single
        word.
    -   Basic Carbon types will be named similarly to keywords.
    -   Other code will use the guidelines for idiomatic Carbon code.

In other words:

| Item                   | Convention         | Explanation                                                                                |
| ---------------------- | ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Packages               | `UpperCamelCase`   | Used for compile-time lookup.                                                              |
| Types                  | `UpperCamelCase`   | Resolved at compile-time.                                                                  |
| Functions              | `UpperCamelCase`   | Resolved at compile-time.                                                                  |
| Methods                | `UpperCamelCase`   | Equivalent to functions.                                                                   |
| Generic parameters     | `UpperCamelCase`   | May vary based on inputs, but are ultimately resolved at compile-time.                     |
| Compile-time constants | `UpperCamelCase`   | Resolved at compile-time. See [constants](#constants] for more remarks.                    |
| Variables              | `lower_snake_case` | May be reassigned and thus require runtime information.                                    |
| Member variables       | `lower_snake_case` | Behave like variables. See [properties](#properties) for more remarks.                     |
| Properties             | `lower_snake_case` | Behave as wrappers for class members. See [properties](#properties) for more remarks.      |
| Keywords               | `lower_snake_case` | Special, and developers can be expected to be comfortable with this casing cross-language. |
| Basic Carbon types     | `lower_snake_case` | Treated as similar to keywords.                                                            |
| Complex Carbon types   | `UpperCamelCase`   | Behave like normal types.                                                                  |

## Details

### Constants

While `let` may be used to designate a constant, consider the following code:

```carbon
package Example;

let CompileTimeConstant: i32 = 7;

fn RuntimeFunction(let runtime_constant: i32);
```

In this example, `CompileTimeConstant` has a singular value (`7`) which is known
at compile-time. As such, it uses `UpperCamelCase`.

On the other hand, `runtime_constant` may be constant due to `let`, but it is
assigned at runtime when `RuntimeFunction` is called. Its value is only known in
a given runtime invocation of `RuntimeFunction`. As such, it uses
`lower_camel_case`.

### Properties

> NOTE: Property syntax hasn't been established for Carbon, but is expected, so
> this proposal aims to include it.

The primary purpose of a
[property](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Property_(programming)>) is to provide
a transparent wrapper to a private member variable. This may be done for reasons
such as guaranteeing lazy initialization of data on first access, or providing a
helpful breakpoint for debug access. Regardless of the reason, we want it to be
trivial for properties to replace member variables without affecting clients of
an API, and so they use the same naming scheme.

Private member variables should use a `_` suffix in order to prevent name
collisions. We discourage private properties.

## Rationale based on Carbon's goals

TODO: How does this proposal effectively advance Carbon's goals? Rather than
re-stating the full motivation, this should connect that motivation back to
Carbon's stated goals for the project or language. This may evolve during
review. Use links to appropriate goals, for example:
