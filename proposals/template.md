# TODO: Initial proposal setup

1. Create a GitHub tracking issue in this repo using
   [the template](https://github.com/carbon-language/carbon-lang/issues/new?template=proposal.md).
2. Name this file `/proposals/p####.md`, where `####` should be the issue
   number.
3. Prepare a pull request with the proposal, and add a link to it on the
   tracking issue.
   - Although you may want to add more files to the pull request later, most
     proposals will be very bare at this point.
4. Delete this section.

TODOs indicate where content should be updated for a proposal. See
[Carbon Governance and Evolution](https://github.com/carbon-language/carbon-lang/blob/master/docs/project/evolution.md)
for more details.
