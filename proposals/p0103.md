## Problem

Bidirectional type inference creates problems for human understanding of code,
harms predictability by allowing long chains of indirect reasoning, and requires
more complexity in tools dealing with Carbon code.

## Proposal

Add a
["Unidirectional type propagation" principle](/docs/project/principles/unidirectional-type-propagation.md).
See that document for details.
