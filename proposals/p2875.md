## Abstract

Specify the behavior of function calls and the type and behavior of the entity
introduced by a function declaration.

## Problem

Functions are a primitive building block through which we define Carbon's
execution semantics, but we don't currently have a specification for what a
function is in Carbon nor how function calls work. We have open questions around
whether Carbon has first-class function types, how types can overload the
function call operation, and how callable entities such as the name of a
parameterized class fit into the picture -- are they functions or something
else?

## Background

This proposal assumes the reader understands how functions and function pointers
work in C or C++.

## Proposal

A function declaration in Carbon introduces a new, unique type, called a
_function type_. The function name is a stateless value of that function type.

Function calls use C-like syntax: an expression naming a callable is followed by
a syntax resembling a tuple of arguments. There are several kinds of callable:

-   Functions, and more generally values of function types.
-   Bound member functions, such as `my_vector.Begin`.
-   Lambdas, once they are introduced to Carbon.
-   Parameterized entities, such as a generic class `Vector` or a generic
    interface `AddWith`.
-   Values of dependent types that are constrained to be callable.
-   User-defined class types that overload function call syntax.

In the first four cases, argument deduction is used to determine the values of
deduced arguments, and then pattern matching is used to bind parameter values to
arguments.

In the remaining cases, the built-in `Call` interface is used to determine the
semantics of the call, and the call `F(args)` is translated into
`F.(Call(ArgTypes).Op)(args)`. Note that this is itself a bound member function
call, and `Call(ArgTypes)` is a call to a parameterized entity, so this
transformation is only performed once.

## Details

### Functions and function types

A function declaration such as

```
fn F[T:! type](x: T) -> T { return x; }
```

introduces a value named `F`, whose type is a unique _function type_. Distinct
functions have distinct function types, even if they have the same signature. A
function type is an empty, trivial type. There is no way to name a function type
other than asking for the type of the function value.

```
// Compile-time function.
fn TypeOf[T:! type](x: T) -> type { return T; }

// ✅ `F` is a first-class value with a first-class type.
alias FType = TypeOf(F);
var my_f: FType = F;
```

Function values are regular values that can be stored in variables, passed to
functions, and so on.

```
fn G() -> i32 {
  // ✅ `my_f` has function type `FType`. This is a direct call to `F`.
  return my_f(1);
}

fn Sort[template F:! type, T:! type](v: Vector(T)*, f: F);
fn Compare(a: i32, b: i32) -> Ordering { return a.(Ordered.Compare)(b); }
fn SortInts(v: Vector(i32)*) { Sort(v, Compare); }
```

For the purpose of the orphan rule, a function type is considered to be declared
by the function declaration that introduces the function value.

### Call syntax

Calls take the form `a(b, c, d)`. This is syntactically equivalent to a primary
expression followed by a tuple literal, except that a trailing comma is
not required for the case of a single argument, `a(b)`.

The callee can be a name, a literal, a member access, or some more complex
expression enclosed parentheses.

### Direct calls

When the callee in a call expression can be resolved to a declaration, either
because it is the name of a parameterized entity like a generic class or
interface, or because it has a function type, the call is a _direct call_.

In a direct call, a call signature is available which is used to check the given
arguments against the callee's declared implicit and explicit parameters. This
checking proceeds as follows:

-   Argument deduction is performed by comparing the declared parameter types
    against the actual parameter types and deducing values for implicit
    arguments that make the types equal.
-   Then, for each binding in the explicit parameter list in turn, all argument
    values that have been deduced are substituted into the parameter.
    -   If the parameter is a `template :!` binding, the argument expression is
        converted to a constant value phase expression of the type of the
        binding.
    -   If the parameter is a non-`template` `:!` binding, the argument
        expression is converted to a symbolic value phase expression of the type
        of the binding.
    -   Otherwise, the parameter is pattern-matched against the argument.
-   If a parameter is a `:!` binding, its corresponding converted argument
    expression is evaluated, and its value is added to the list of deduced
    argument values before any later parameters are processed.

The result of the call expression depends on the callee:

-   If the callee is a parameterized entity such as a generic class or a generic
    interface, the result is the specific instance of that generic, such as a
    class or interface, and the call is a value expression of type `type`.
-   If the callee is a function value, the call is an initializing expression
    whose type is the substituted return type of the function. When evaluated,
    the call expression will invoke the function and produce whatever value it
    returns.

### Generic callable parameters

A generic parameter can be constrained to be a callable type using the `Call`
interface:

```
interface Call(Args: type) {
  let Result:! type;
  fn Op[self: Self](args: Args) -> Result;
}
```

> **TODO:** `Call` should be variadic. For now, we model it as taking a tuple
> type, and we model `Call.Op` as taking a tuple value.

For example:

```
fn Sort[T:! type, F:! Call((T, T)) where .Result = Ordering]
       (v: Vector(T)*, cmp: F) {
```

A call expression that is not a direct call is translated into an invocation of
`Call(Args).Op`, where `Args` is the type of the call's argument tuple.

```
  // In Sort...
  auto ord: auto = cmp((*v)[i], (*v)[j]);
  // ... is translated into ...
  auto ord: auto = cmp.(Call((T, T)).Op)((*v)[i], (*v)[j]);
```

### Function types and `Call`

A `fn` declaration that declares a function with a runtime signature (see below)
implicitly provides an `impl` of `Call` matching the function signature.

```
fn Select[T:! type](b: bool, x: T, y: T) -> T {
  return if b then x else y;
}

// Generated:
impl forall [T:! type, BType:! ImplicitAs(bool)]
    Select as (BType, T, T) where .Result = T {
  fn Op[self: Self](args: (BType, T, T)) {
    let (b: bool, x: T, y: T) = args;
    return Select(b, x, y);
  }
}
```

Implicit conversions are permitted for parameters whose types do not involve
deduced parameters. The intent is for the `impl` to support indirect calls in
the same cases where the function supports direct calls, with the same meaning.

```
fn TakeI32Fn[F:! Call(i32)](f: F);
fn I64Fn(n: i64);
fn Run() {
  // ✅ `I64Fn` can be called with an `i32`, because
  // `i32 impls ImplicitAs(i64)`.
  TakeI32Fn(I64Fn);
}
```

> **Note:** A call made using the `Call` interface always takes its arguments as

A _runtime signature_ is one that doesn't depend on any compile-time parameters
in its explicit argument list, nor on any refutable pattern matching between the
call arguments and the function parameters.

```
fn Runtime[T:! type](x: T);
fn CompileTime(T:! type, x: T);
// 🤷 Undecided whether this is valid.
fn RefutablePattern(1 as i32);

fn Run() {
  // ✅ Calls `Runtime(0)`.
  Runtime.(Call(i32).Op)(0);
  // ❌ Can't call `CompileTime` this way, it doesn't have a runtime signature.
  CompileTime.(Call(type, i32).Op)(i32, 0);
  // ❌ Can't call `RefutablePattern` this way, it can't implement `Call(i32)`
  // for arbitrary i32 arguments.
  RefutablePattern.(Call(i32).Op)(0);
}
```

> **Note:** There is no support for passing compile-time parameters to a checked
> generic function parameter.

### Overloaded call operator

The `Call` interface can be implemented to overload the meaning of the function
call operator for a type.

```
class Func(Arg:! type) {
  impl as Call((Arg,)) where .Result = () {
    fn Op[self: Self](arg: (Arg,)) { Print("hello, world"); }
  }
}

fn Run() {
  let f: Func(i32) = {};
  // ✅ Prints "hello, world".
  f();
}
```

There are no constraints on the callee type, beyond the normal constraints for
implementing an interface.

```
class X { var n: i32; }
// ✅ OK, but inadvisable.
impl {.a: X} as Call(()) where .Result = i32 {
  fn Op[self: Self](args: ()) -> i32 {
    return self.a.n;
  }
}
fn Run() -> i32 {
  return {.a = {.n = 1} as X}();
}
```

There is no way to directly define a function-like callable class type that
takes a compile-time argument. This is similar to the situation in C++ where
there is no way to define an `operator()` for a value `x` of class type so that
`x<T>()` passes `T` to `operator()` at compile time. However, this can be worked
around by putting the compile-time value in the type of an argument instead:

```
class Wrap(T:! type) {}
class Callable {
  impl forall [T:! Printable] as Call((Wrap(T), T)) where .Result = () {
    fn Op[self: Self](args: (Wrap(T), T)) {
      let (_: auto, v: T) = args;
      Print(v);
    }
  }
}
fn CallIt[F:! Call(Wrap(i32), i32)](f: F) {
  f({} as Wrap(i32), 0);
}
fn Run() {
  CallIt({} as Callable);
}
```

## Rationale

Principles:

-   [Principle: one static open extension mechanism](/docs/project/principles/static_open_extension.md).
    -   Overloaded calls are supported by implementing an interface.
-   [Principle: Prefer providing only one way to do a given thing](/docs/project/principles/one_way.md).
    -   There is only one obvious way to pass a callable to a generic function,
        and it works efficiently whether the argument is a function, a callable
        object, or (eventually) a lambda.

Goals:

-   [Performance-critical software](/docs/project/goals.md#performance-critical-software)
    -   Passing around functions is no less efficient than passing around
        callable objects.
-   [Code that is easy to read, understand, and write](/docs/project/goals.md#code-that-is-easy-to-read-understand-and-write)
    -   Function types in C and C++ are notoriously hard to read. We avoid this
        problem by not having signature-based function types.
-   [Interoperability with and migration from existing C++ code](/docs/project/goals.md#interoperability-with-and-migration-from-existing-c-code)
    -   As [future work](#function-pointers) we have the basis for a design for
        function pointers. C++ function pointers can be modeled in Carbon code
        as values that implement `Call`, as can member function pointers.

## Alternatives considered

### Signature-based function types

We could give each function signature a distinct type, as is done in C and C++.
This would provide a story for [function pointers](#function-pointers) that does
not rely on generics or type erasure or fancy representation optimizations.

The main down side of this approach is one we see frequently in C++: passing a
function to a template generic would be less efficient than passing a function
object to the same template. For example, in C++, given

```
std::vector<int> v;
bool cmp(int a, int b) { return simple_calculation(a, b); }
```

... calling `ranges::sort(v, cmp)` may be much less efficient than calling
`ranges::sort(v, [](int a, int b) { return cmp(a, b); })`, because the latter
performs a direct call and the former passes a function pointer, resulting in an
indirect call.

Making functions result in unique types means that calls to functions, lambdas,
and function-like objects have semantics that are more similar and have similar
efficiency properties.

### Make direct and indirect calls behave uniformly

It would be desirable to remove the difference between direct and indirect
calls. Unfortunately, that doesn't seem to be practical, for a number of
reasons:

-   Indirect calls need to be transformed into another call expression. We need
    a foundation for our semantics at some point, where we make an actual
    function call rather than transforming one function call into another.
-   We have chosen that
    [interfaces are the only static open extension mechanism](/docs/project/principles/static_open_extension.md).
    This means that any general mechanism we provide to overload function calls
    must fit within the boundaries of Carbon's `interface` and `impl`
    mechanisms.
-   We could try to support passing compile-time parameters to functions by
    specifying in the `impl` query whether each argument can be passed at
    compile time, but any such query will need to be able to fall back to
    passing each argument at runtime, which can result in an exponential-time
    search for a matching `impl`.

## Future work

### Overloading

We intend to support function overloading, and although it outside the scope of
this proposal, it is important to ensure that we have reasonable paths forward
to support overloading within this framework.

An overloaded function has multiple different signatures -- sets of implicit and
explicit parameters -- that will be checked against the provided arguments. In
this proposal, that means that a set of overloaded functions introduces a single
function type that supports being called in different ways.

Depending on how we approach overloading, overload selection might be done by
checking each candidate in turn until we find one that matches, or checking them
all and somehow selecting the best match, and our current intent is to use the
former approach. Translated into this proposal, one important consequence is
that the function type corresponding to the set of overloaded functions has
multiple parameterized implementations of the `Call(...)` interface, and the
implementation selected for a particular call will need to follow whatever rules
the overloading mechanism picks. For example, if function overloading picks the
first matching function, then given the following, using placeholder syntax:

```
overloaded fn Abs[T:! Unsigned](x: T) -> T { return x; }
overloaded fn Abs[T:! Floating](x: T) -> T { return x < 0 ? -x : x }
```

we would synthesize implementations that behave as follows:

```
match_first {
  impl forall [T:! Unsigned] Abs as Call(T) where .Result = T { ... }
  impl forall [T:! Floating] Abs as Call(T) where .Result = T { ... }
}
```

For a type that is `Unsigned & Floating`, the former `impl` will be selected,
matching the behavior of overload selection.

### Lambdas

A lambda is expected to behave much like a function under this proposal, with
the primary difference being that lambdas can be stateful, whereas functions are
stateless.

### Function pointers

For interoperability with C++, and for purposes of cheaply storing references to
stateless functions, function pointers should be supported. A function pointer
could be modeled as:

```
alias FunctionPtr(Args:! type, Result:! type) =
    DynPtr(Stateless & Call(Args) where .Result = Result);
```

where:

-   `Stateless` is an interface describing types that are empty, do not have a
    notion of identity, and for which instances can be created and destroyed
    trivially.
-   `DynPtr` is a
    [type that performs type erasure and runtime dispatch](/docs/design/generics/details.md#dynamic-types)
    for a given facet type.
-   `DynPtr` has an optimization that `DynPtr(Stateless & I)`, where `I` is an
    interface with exactly one associated function, is represented as a pointer
    to that function.
