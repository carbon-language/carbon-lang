## Problem

This statement is syntactic sugar for a set of other patterns. Actually, there
is no problem.

## Background

## Proposal

A `let` or `var` declaration may be used with a
[refutable pattern](https://github.com/carbon-language/carbon-lang/blob/trunk/docs/design/README.md#refutable-patterns)
if an `else` clause is supplied, as in:

```carbon
let (x: i32, true) = F(1) else {
  // Can't use `x` here.
  return false;
}
// `x` is an r-value
var (y: i32, true) = F(x) else {
  return false;
}
// `y` is an l-value
y += 2;
```

If the pattern successfully matches the runtime value, values are bound
according to the pattern, and execution skips over the `else` code block and
proceeds to the next statement.

If the pattern does not match, the `else` code block will be executed. None of
the bindings from the pattern will be in scope in the `else` code block. No
control flow path in the `else` code block may continue to the statement after.
All paths must end with a `break`, `continue`, `return`, or call to a function
that never returns.
