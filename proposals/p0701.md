## Problem

We need facilities for defining new nominal
[record types](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Record_(computer_science)>) in
Carbon. They will need to support object-oriented features such as methods.

## Background

This is a follow up to
[#561: Basic classes: use cases, struct literals, struct types, and future work](https://github.com/carbon-language/carbon-lang/pull/561)
which laid a foundation.

## Proposal

The proposal is to update [docs/design/classes.md](docs/design/classes.md) as
described in [this PR](https://github.com/carbon-language/carbon-lang/pull/701).

## Rationale based on Carbon's goals

This particular proposal is focusing on [the Carbon
goal](/docs/project/goals.md#code-that-is-easy-to-read-understand-and -write)
that code is "easy to read, understand, and write." Future proposals will
address other aspects of the class type design such as performance.

## Alternatives considered

The proposed method syntax was decided in question-for-leads issue
[#494: Method syntax](https://github.com/carbon-language/carbon-lang/issues/494).
FIXME: Summarize discussion, including alternatives and rationale.
