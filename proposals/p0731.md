## Problem

We want to Carbon to have a high quality generics feature that achieves the
goals set out in [#24](https://github.com/carbon-language/carbon-lang/pull/24).
This is too big to land in a single proposal. This proposal continues
[#553](https://github.com/carbon-language/carbon-lang/pull/553) defining the
details of:

-   adapters
-   associated types and other constants
-   parameterized interfaces

## Background

This is a follow on to these previous generics proposals:

-   [#24: Generics goals](https://github.com/carbon-language/carbon-lang/pull/24)
-   [#447: Generics terminology](https://github.com/carbon-language/carbon-lang/pull/447)
-   [#524: Generics overview](https://github.com/carbon-language/carbon-lang/pull/524)
-   [#553: Generics details part 1](https://github.com/carbon-language/carbon-lang/pull/553)

The content for this proposal was extracted from a larger
[Generics combined draft proposal](https://github.com/carbon-language/carbon-lang/pull/36).

## Proposal

This is a proposal to add multiple sections to
[this design document on generics details](/docs/design/generics/details.md).

## Details

TODO: Fully explain the details of the proposed solution.

## Rationale based on Carbon's goals

TODO: How does this proposal effectively advance Carbon's goals? Rather than
re-stating the full motivation, this should connect that motivation back to
Carbon's stated goals for the project or language. This may evolve during
review.

## Alternatives considered

### Syntax for associated constants

Associated constants use `let` with `:!` to express that these are compile-time
values, matching the use in classes described in [#772](p0722.md#let-constants).

### Others

Other alternatives considered will be in a future proposal. Some of them can be
seen in a rough form in
[#36](https://github.com/carbon-language/carbon-lang/pull/36).
