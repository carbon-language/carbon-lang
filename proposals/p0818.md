## Problem

We want to Carbon to have a high quality generics feature that achieves the
goals set out in [#24](https://github.com/carbon-language/carbon-lang/pull/24).
This is too big to land in a single proposal. This proposal continues
[#553](https://github.com/carbon-language/carbon-lang/pull/553) defining the
details of:

-   adapters
-   associated types and other constants
-   parameterized interfaces

## Background

This is a follow on to these previous generics proposals:

-   [#24: Generics goals](https://github.com/carbon-language/carbon-lang/pull/24)
-   [#447: Generics terminology](https://github.com/carbon-language/carbon-lang/pull/447)
-   [#524: Generics overview](https://github.com/carbon-language/carbon-lang/pull/524)
-   [#553: Generics details part 1](https://github.com/carbon-language/carbon-lang/pull/553)
-   [#731: Generics details 2: adapters, associated types, parameterized interfaces](https://github.com/carbon-language/carbon-lang/pull/731)

Some of the content for this proposal was extracted from a larger
[Generics combined draft proposal](https://github.com/carbon-language/carbon-lang/pull/36).

## Proposal

This is a proposal to add two sections to
[this design document on generics details](/docs/design/generics/details.md) and
an
[appendix with the algorithm that determines archetypes for generic type expressions](/docs/design/generics/appendix-archetype-algorithm.md).

## Rationale based on Carbon's goals

Much of this rationale was captured in the
[Generics goals proposal](https://github.com/carbon-language/carbon-lang/pull/24).

## Alternatives considered

FIXME
