## Problem

C++ supports
[operator overloading](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operator_overloading), and
we would like Carbon to as well. This proposal is about the general problem, not
the specifics application to any particular operator.

## Background

The generics feature is the
[single static open extension mechanism](/docs/project/principles/static_open_extension.md)
in Carbon, and so will be what we use operator overloading. We have already
started specifying the ability to extend or customize the behavior of operators
by implementing interfaces, as in these proposals:

-   [#820: Implicit conversions](https://github.com/carbon-language/carbon-lang/pull/820)
-   [#845: as expressions](https://github.com/carbon-language/carbon-lang/pull/845)
-   [#911: Conditional expressions](https://github.com/carbon-language/carbon-lang/pull/911)
-   [#1083: Arithmetic expressions](https://github.com/carbon-language/carbon-lang/pull/1083)

Proposal
[#702: Comparison operators](https://github.com/carbon-language/carbon-lang/pull/702)
specified
[using interfaces for overloading the comparison operators](p0702.md#overloading),
but did not pin down specifically what those interfaces are.

## Proposal

This proposal adds a
["Operator overloading" section](/docs/design/generics/details.md#operator-overloading)
to the [detailed design of generics](/docs/design/generics/details.md).

## Rationale based on Carbon's goals

TODO: How does this proposal effectively advance Carbon's goals? Rather than
re-stating the full motivation, this should connect that motivation back to
Carbon's stated goals for the project or language. This may evolve during
review. Use links to appropriate goals, for example:

-   [Community and culture](/docs/project/goals.md#community-and-culture)
-   [Language tools and ecosystem](/docs/project/goals.md#language-tools-and-ecosystem)
-   [Performance-critical software](/docs/project/goals.md#performance-critical-software)
-   [Software and language evolution](/docs/project/goals.md#software-and-language-evolution)
-   [Code that is easy to read, understand, and write](/docs/project/goals.md#code-that-is-easy-to-read-understand-and-write)
-   [Practical safety and testing mechanisms](/docs/project/goals.md#practical-safety-and-testing-mechanisms)
-   [Fast and scalable development](/docs/project/goals.md#fast-and-scalable-development)
-   [Modern OS platforms, hardware architectures, and environments](/docs/project/goals.md#modern-os-platforms-hardware-architectures-and-environments)
-   [Interoperability with and migration from existing C++ code](/docs/project/goals.md#interoperability-with-and-migration-from-existing-c-code)
