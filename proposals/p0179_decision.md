## Open questions

### Should the name of the team be "toolchain team" or "implementation team"?

Some core team members expressed a preference for "implementation team", none
expressed a preference for "toolchain team", all were fine either way. As
gribozavr noted, and everyone at the review meeting agreed, the team should be
free to choose its own name.

## Rationale

Carbon's goals include providing a reference implementation and tooling.
Delivering this complex software requires a dedicated team, vision, leadership,
and a degree of autonomy.
