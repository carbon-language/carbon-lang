## Abstract

The Carbon Project relied on the three leads to handle conduct concerns
initially as it bootstrapped its community team and expertise. We now have an
active and effective community lead and team of moderators. Our community lead
has worked to train and ramp up a new and independent conduct team.

This proposal both provides an overview of the process and hands off conduct
handling to the new team! Going forward, we expect routine updates to the
conduct team to happen without full proposals as they allow trained folks to
rotate in and out of this difficult but essential role on the project.

## Problem

-   Our Code of Conduct team is made up of those with the highest power in the
    community (Carbon leads), and our current framework does not allow for clear
    accountability in terms of their own conduct due to this lack of separation.
-   The diversity of backgrounds and perspectives is limited among our current
    CoC team.
-   The Carbon leads have limited time and availability to intervene in urgent
    and important misconduct situations.

So, it is time to build a specialized team to deal with escalations which is not
subordinate to the Carbon leads, and is able to handle diverse misconduct
escalations in an adequate and timely manner. This means we can recruit and/or
train people from diverse backgrounds to handle such escalations for the Carbon
community, and provide competent support to the leads, the rest of the
moderation team, and everyone else in the community.

TODO: What problem are you trying to solve? How important is that problem? Who
is impacted by it?

## Background

Our Code of Conduct:
https://github.com/carbon-language/carbon-lang/blob/trunk/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md

Our current CoC team:

-   Chandler Carruth (@chandlerc on Discord and GitHub)
-   Kate Gregory (@KateGregory on Discord and GitHub)
-   Richard Smith (@zygoloid on Discord and GitHub)

## Proposal

Recruit and train 5+ potential new conduct team members to deal with
conduct-related escalations on behalf of and for the Carbon community, and
replace the current CoC team as soon as enough members are ready.

We should always have at least 3 conduct team members available to respond
promptly, even factoring in vacations, getting sick, or other normal
disruptions.

Subsequent updates to the exact members will be managed by the new conduct team
themselves, and without full proposals but just PRs to update the relevant
documentation.

## Details

### Initial team members

-   TBA

We will continue to look for more candidates in order to get to a point where we
have a sustainable number, especially as the community grows.

### Process

Selection and sourcing:

-   Candidates were identified and recruited by our Community lead.
-   Candidates met with both Carbon leads and the Community lead individually to
    make sure everyone was comfortable with the role and responsibilities
    involved.

Onboarding and support:

-   New members will have access to coaching and mentoring from the Community
    lead as a diversity, equity and inclusion specialist, and general support by
    a senior moderation team member.
-   We organize regular informal moderation meetups to learn with and from each
    other, including a book club.

Exit:

-   We are aware that this work tends to be straining and that each person's
    involvement may only be temporary.
-   We will make sure that conduct team members feel safe to leave the team and
    community when they need to step out by developing a bench of candidates.

## Rationale

-   [Community and culture](/docs/project/goals.md#community-and-culture)
    -   The Carbon project needs to have an effective and scalable process for
        handling conduct concerns to continue to be an inclusive and welcoming
        community.
    -   Having a separate team focused on these concerns both enables more
        specialized skills and can provide a more effective path to hold the
        Carbon leads accountable to the same conduct standards.

## Alternatives considered

### Make no changes

This would leave the fundamental problems of both scale and external
accountability unresolved.

### Have some overlap between Carbon leads and the Conduct team

We considered having some amount of overlap between the leads and the conduct
team on an ongoing basis. While this would help ensure that the Carbon leads are
aware and attending to the community, culture, and conduct needs of the project,
it ultimately had a number of disadvantages that made us decide to have a fully
separate team:

-   The Conduct team can and should focus their energy and leverage their
    special skills at evaluating conduct challenges. This is different from the
    focus, skills, and priorities of the leads.
-   The leads want to encourage the conduct team to hold the leads own conduct
    accountable to the rest of the community, and so want to keep the conduct
    team especially as independent as possible.
-   Even if in practice no conflict arises, having a _visible_ separation is
    valuable to the community to build trust.
-   Having two fully independent groups helps facilitate them each helping,
    supporting, empowering, and when necessary, challenging the other.
