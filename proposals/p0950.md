## Problem

There were some concerns about facet types leaking out of generic code in return
types. Some initial fixes for this were done in
[PR #900](https://github.com/carbon-language/carbon-lang/pull/900), but there
remain concerns, for example when associated types are involved.

In particular, given an interface method with return type using an associated
type, as in:

```
interface Deref {
  let Result:! Type;
  fn DoDeref[me: Self]() -> Result;
}

class IntHandle {
  impl Deref {
    let Result:! Type = i32;
    fn DoDeref[me: Self]() -> Result { ... }
  }
}
```

Since `Result` has type `Type`, we had the problem that `IntHandle.DoDeref`
would have to return `i32 as Type`, instead of the desired `i32`.

We also think we can simplify the model by eliminating the facet type concept
and syntax.

## Proposal

This proposal removes facet types, introduces archetypes in their place,
clarifies how associated types work outside of a generic function, and specifies
how a generic `let` statement in a function body works.

## Details

The details of this proposal are in the changes to these generics design
documents:

-   [Overview](/docs/design/generics/overview.md)
-   [Goals](/docs/design/generics/goals.md)
-   [Terminology](/docs/design/generics/terminology.md)
-   [Details](/docs/design/generics/details.md)

## Rationale based on Carbon's goals

This proposal
[adds a goal](/docs/design/generics/goals.md#path-from-regular-functions) about
minimizing the differences between a regular function and one with a generic
parameter from the perspective of the caller. This is to support the
[software and language evolution](/docs/project/goals.md#software-and-language-evolution)
goal by reducing the amount of changes needed to source code when generalizing a
function.

This change is also a simplification to the programming model, removing a
concept that developers have to learn and reducing the number of types a program
deals with. This is in support of the
[code that is easy to read, understand, and write](/docs/project/goals.md#code-that-is-easy-to-read-understand-and-write)
goal.

### Status quo: facet types

FIXME

### Name lookup in type and type-of-type

FIXME

### Generic 'let' erases connection to original type

FIXME

OPTION A
[here](https://discord.com/channels/655572317891461132/708431657849585705/908834806551445554)

### No generic 'let'

FIXME

chandlerc believes including generic `let` is more consistent

Allows replicating the change in type behavior of calling a generic function
without having to introduce a function call.
