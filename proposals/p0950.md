## Problem

TODO: What problem are you trying to solve? How important is that problem? Who
is impacted by it?

## Background

TODO: Is there any background that readers should consider to fully understand
this problem and your approach to solving it?

## Proposal

TODO: Briefly and at a high level, how do you propose to solve the problem? Why
will that in fact solve it?

## Details

TODO: Fully explain the details of the proposed solution.

## Rationale based on Carbon's goals

TODO: How does this proposal effectively advance Carbon's goals? Rather than
re-stating the full motivation, this should connect that motivation back to
Carbon's stated goals for the project or language. This may evolve during
review. Use links to appropriate goals, for example:

-   [Community and culture](/docs/project/goals.md#community-and-culture)
-   [Language tools and ecosystem](/docs/project/goals.md#language-tools-and-ecosystem)
-   [Performance-critical software](/docs/project/goals.md#performance-critical-software)
-   [Software and language evolution](/docs/project/goals.md#software-and-language-evolution)
-   [Code that is easy to read, understand, and write](/docs/project/goals.md#code-that-is-easy-to-read-understand-and-write)
-   [Practical safety and testing mechanisms](/docs/project/goals.md#practical-safety-and-testing-mechanisms)
-   [Fast and scalable development](/docs/project/goals.md#fast-and-scalable-development)
-   [Modern OS platforms, hardware architectures, and environments](/docs/project/goals.md#modern-os-platforms-hardware-architectures-and-environments)
-   [Interoperability with and migration from existing C++ code](/docs/project/goals.md#interoperability-with-and-migration-from-existing-c-code)
