## Problem

`while` is noted in the [language overview](/docs/design/README.md#while), but
is provisional. Control flow is important, and `while` is basic; the form is
similar in many languages, even if details may change.

## Background

-   C++: A couple example languages following C++'s syntax closely are Java and
    TypeScript.

    ```cc
    while (x) {
      DoSomething();
    }

    do {
      DoSomethingElse();
    } while (y);
    ```

-   Python: Python does not provide `do`/`while`. However, the `else` syntax for
    having code execute if the condition is _never_ true may be of interest.

    ```python
    while x:
      DoSomething()

    while True:
      DoSomethingElse()
      if not y:
        break

    while z:
      print("z is true")
    else:
      print("z was never true")
    ```

-   Swift: Swift uses `repeat` instead of `do`.

    ```swift
    while x {
      DoSomething()
    }

    repeat {
      DoSomethingElse()
    } while y
    ```

-   Rust: Rust provides only a basic `while` loop, relying on the condition-less
    `loop` to achieve `do`/`while`-like behavior.

    ```rust
    while x {
      DoSomething();
    }

    loop {
      DoSomethingElse();
      if (!y) { break; }
    }
    ```

-   Go: Go has no `while` loops, only `for` loops. However, a `for` can be
    written similar to a `while`.

    ```go
    for x {
      DoSomething()
    }

    for {
      DoSomethingElse();
      if !y { break; }
    }
    ```

## Proposal

Carbon should adopt `while` loop syntax consistent with C/C++. In particular:

-   `while`: used in both `while` and `do`/`while` loops.
-   `continue`: continues with the next loop iteration, starting with the loop
    condition.
-   `break`: breaks out of the loop, without testing the loop condition.

## Details

Loop syntax looks like:

-   `while (` _boolean expression_ `) {` _statements_ `}`

While will evaluate the loop condition before each pass of the loop, only
continuing if the loop condition is true. When the loop condition evaluates to
false, the loop completes.

Similar to the
[`if`/`else` proposal](https://github.com/carbon-language/carbon-lang/pull/285),
the braces are optional and must be paired (`{ ... }`) if present. When there
are no braces, only one statement is allowed.

`continue` will continue with the next loop iteration directly, skipping any
other statements in the loop body. The next loop iteration behaves as normal,
starting with the condition being tested.

`break` exits the loop immediately, without testing the condition.

All of this is consistent with C/C++ behavior.

### Executable semantics form

```
%token WHILE
%token DO
%token CONTINUE
%token BREAK

statement:
  WHILE '(' expression ')' statement
| CONTINUE ';'
| BREAK ';'
| /* pre-existing statements elided */
;
```

Note that `continue` and `break` should only be valid in a loop context.

## Caveats

### C++ as baseline

This baseline syntax is based on C++, following the migration sub-goal
[Familiarity for experienced C++ developers with a gentle learning curve](/docs/project/goals.md#interoperability-with-and-migration-from-existing-c-code).
To the extent that this proposal anchors on a particular approach, it aims to
anchor on C++'s existing syntax, consistent with that sub-goal.

Alternatives will generally reflect breaking consistency with C++ syntax. While
most proposals may consider alternatives more, this proposal suggests a
threshold of only accepting alternatives that skew from C++ syntax if they are
clearly better; the priority in this proposal is to _avoid debate_ and produce a
trivial proposal. Where an alternative would trigger debate, it should be
examined by an advocate in a separate proposal.

### `do`/`while`

`do`/`while` is omitted from this proposal because of disagreement about whether
it should be included in Carbon. It's better to have `do`/`while` considered
separately as a result, in order to separate review of the non-contentious
`while`.

## Alternatives considered

Both alternatives from the
[`if`/`else` proposal](https://github.com/carbon-language/carbon-lang/pull/285)
apply to `while` as well: we could remove parentheses, require braces, or both.
The conclusions mirror here in order to avoid a divergence in syntax.

Additional alternatives follow.

### `else` block

Some languages support an `else` following `while`. This can support, for
example, running logic if the `while` condition never evaluated true, and so the
typical loop body has never run. For example, in Python:

```
while x:
  print("x is true")
else:
  print("x was *never* true")
```

This may be added later, but is not part of this proposal because it is not part
of C++ syntax.

### Infinite loops

`while (true)` is a common idiom in C++ for an infinite loop. It may be useful
to add dedicated syntax for this, such as Rust's `loop`. However, this may be
addressed as part of a more generic looping solution that better addresses
complex situations (such as advanced use of C++'s `for (...; ...; ...)`).
Regardless, `loop` is not part of C++ syntax and so we should be cautious about
adding it.

### Selection statements with initializer

[Selections statements with initializer](http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2016/p0305r1.html)
added `if (init; cond)` syntax to C++17. A corresponding `while (init; cond)` is
not proposed here, for several reasons:

-   Although P0305 added this syntax to `if` and `switch`, it does not appear to
    be in `while`. Its addition in this proposal would be a divergence from C++
    which should probably be evaluated separately.

-   There is some disagreement about the syntax used. For example, P0305
    mentions a `with` keyword as an alternative, and there's some favor for
    that. Particularly if Carbon omits the `for (init; cond; inc)` form that
    `if (init; cond)` is structurally similar to, it may not make sense to do
    `while (init; cond)`.

-   It's possible that `if ((var status_code c = bar()) != SUCCESS)` will be
    valid in Carbon, solving some of the concerns that led to `if (init; cond)`
    syntax in a different way.

As a consequence, between not being in C++ and requiring more discussion,
`while (init; cond)` syntax is not part of this proposal.
