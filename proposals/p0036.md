# Carbon: Add initial version of "Carbon Generics"

- **[Tracking issue](https://github.com/carbon-language/carbon-lang/issues/36)**
- **Status:** WIP
- **Created:** 2020-05-29

**_PLEASE_ DO NOT SHARE OUTSIDE CARBON FORUMS**

## Problem

Generics are the preferred way of writing generic code in Carbon. This is a system
to provide parameterized types and functions. It will perform more validation at
the time the parameterized entity is defined using generics than with templates
where some checking is delayed until the parameter used at the callsite is known.

Generics are both a foundational piece of Carbon and tricky to do well, and so
are the subject of a lot of our early focus.

## Background

See [PR #24 proposing generics principles](https://github.com/carbon-language/carbon-lang/pull/24).

TODO: Links to generics systems in Swift, Rust, Java, etc., and templates in C++.

## Proposal

We propose a model for Carbon interfaces and generics based on treating interfaces
as a type whose values are facet types.

## Details

The details of this proposal are in the file `docs/designs/generics-overview.md`,
with the overall structure, as well as these files it refers to for individual
pieces:

- `docs/designs/generics-motivation.md`: motivating use cases
- `docs/designs/generics-terminology.md`: terminology and problem statement
- `docs/designs/generics-interface-type-types.md`: deep dive into interfaces as
   facet type-type

## Alternatives considered

These are detailed in `docs/designs/generics-overview.md`, under
[Programming model proposals](https://github.com/josh11b/carbon-lang/blob/generics-docs/docs/designs/generics-overview.md#programming-model-proposals).
