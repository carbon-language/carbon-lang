## Abstract

A statement is always terminated by a semicolon, such as `Foo();` or
`x = x + 2;`. Semicolons will also be required in some other situations,
including declarations that don't provide a definition, such as `class C;`,
`fn Foo();`, or `var x: i32 = 0;`.

Carbon won't require semicolons for declarations that include a definition, such
as `class C { ... }` or `fn Foo() { ... }`.

Carbon's current design has been written assuming the above; this is making
requiring semicolons an explicit decision.

## Problem

Statements need some system for separation. There are two main options for this:

1. Require semicolons to terminate statements.
2. Automatically determine where statements terminate.
    - Some languages, such as Python, define a syntax where a newline terminates
      statements.
    - Other languages, such as Javascript, require semicolons but define rules
      for semicolon insertion.

## Background

### Discussion in Carbon

This was discussed on leads issue
[#1924: Semicolon](https://github.com/carbon-language/carbon-lang/issues/1924).
Some rationale is provided there, stemming from discussion
[#1739: Semicolon](https://github.com/carbon-language/carbon-lang/discussions/1739).

### In other languages

#### Requiring semicolons

In C++, C#, and Java, semicolons are always required.

In Rust, semicolons are generally required, but may be omitted for an
[implicit return](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/keyword.return.html).

#### Optional semicolons

In Python, a line is a
[simple statement](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/simple_stmts.html), and
parentheses are an idiomatic way to create multi-line statements. Semicolons may
be used to explicitly separate statements. For example:

```python
value = (
  "text"
)
a = 1; b = 2; c = 3
```

Swift takes a different approach, where
[statement separation is part of the grammar](https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/documentation/the-swift-programming-language/statements).
This allows some statements to wrap lines. However, Swift still disallows
multiple statements on the same line unless a semicolon is present. For example:

```swift
// One statement in Swift, but two in Python and Kotlin.
var x = 1
      + 1
// Two statements in Swift because of whitespace sensitivity.
var x = 1
      +1
```

Kotlin makes
[newlines usable instead of semicolons in code blocks](https://kotlinlang.org/spec/statements.html#code-blocks).

In JavaScript and TypeScript, semicolons are part of the formal syntax, and
ECMAScript provides
[Automatic Semicolon Insertion (ASI)](https://tc39.es/ecma262/#sec-automatic-semicolon-insertion).
Note ECMAScript also documents
[Interesting Cases](https://tc39.es/ecma262/#sec-interesting-cases-of-automatic-semicolon-insertion)
which may lead to confusion for developers.

In Go, semicolons are similarly part of the formal syntax, and
[certain tokens cause a semicolon insertion](https://go.dev/ref/spec#Semicolons).
This is also used to enforce style, for example by requiring the opening `{` of
an `if` body to be on the same line in order to avoid semicolon insertion.

## Proposal

As described in the abstract, Carbon will require semicolons to terminate
statements and forward declarations.

However, declarations with definitions will not require semicolons. This is
partly in contrast with C++ which would requires a semicolon in
`class C { ... };`.

## Rationale

-   [Language tools and ecosystem](/docs/project/goals.md#language-tools-and-ecosystem)
    -   We expect it to be easier to write tools that parse and operate on
        source code if semicolons are required.
-   [Software and language evolution](/docs/project/goals.md#software-and-language-evolution)
    -   Requiring semicolons leaves open the most evolutionary paths; any
        optional semicolon approach means the design would need to be more
        thoughtful about handling ambiguities.
-   [Code that is easy to read, understand, and write](/docs/project/goals.md#code-that-is-easy-to-read-understand-and-write)
    -   Semicolons are a
        [visual aid](/docs/project/principles/low_context_sensitivity.md#visual-aids)
        that reinforces statement termination, even though they might be viewed
        as a nuisance to write or visually unnecessary for some developers.
        -   Carbon weighs readability more heavily because of the expectation
            that code will be read more often.
-   [Interoperability with and migration from existing C++ code](/docs/project/goals.md#interoperability-with-and-migration-from-existing-c-code)
    -   The use of semicolons is expected to improve familiarity for C++
        developers, even for developers who might prefer optional semicolons.

## Alternatives considered

### Optional semicolons

Semicolons could be made optional. This would most likely be with an approach
similar to Python, based mainly on newlines.

Advantages:

-   Languages with optional semicolons are very popular. Python is either the
    most, or the 2nd most, widely used programming language by most measures
    ([1](https://pypl.github.io/PYPL.html)
    [2](https://octoverse.github.com/2022/top-programming-languages)
    [3](https://www.tiobe.com/tiobe-index/)).
-   Echoes the direction of evolution in other languages.
    -   Swift and Kotlin are examples of recently developed languages that make
        semicolons optional in good ways.
    -   TypeScript may improve the handling of ASI ambiguities by
        [increasing detectability of mistakes](https://medium.com/@eugenkiss/dont-use-semicolons-in-typescript-474ccfe4bdb3).
-   While optional semicolons are unlikely to get complaints, requiring
    semicolons is likely to lead to ongoing friction due to the overall trend.
    This can be seen for languages like Rust
    ([1](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/27116)
    [2](https://internals.rust-lang.org/t/make-some-separators-optional/4846)
    [3](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/issues/2583)
    [4](https://users.rust-lang.org/t/why-semicolons/25074)) or C#
    ([1](https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/issues/5355)
    [2](https://github.com/dotnet/csharplang/discussions/496)
    [3](https://github.com/dotnet/csharplang/discussions/5655)).

Disadvantages:

-   Semicolons are a visual anchor for statement termination when scanning code.
-   Requiring semicolons leaves more evolutionary paths available for Carbon.
    This includes both syntactic changes without introducing ambiguity and
    implicit returns as in Rust.
    -   Although it's not clear Carbon will fully adopt implicit returns,
        similar syntactic choices may arise for lambdas.
-   Semicolons are a signal to the compiler about where statements were intended
    to terminate, and can be used to provide better error detection as a
    consequence.
    -   For contrast, optional semicolons may lead to unintended statements.
        While ASI's problems are
        [documented](https://tc39.es/ecma262/#sec-automatic-semicolon-insertion),
        we expect any optional semicolon approach will lead to some increase in
        bugs that the compiler cannot detect, if only because fewer mistakes are
        necessary in order to produce valid but incorrect code.
-   Making code with no semicolons idiomatic may increase the "strangeness" for
    C++ developers, who are the primary target for Carbon.

Semicolons are expected to be a net benefit, as explained by the
[rationale](#rationale).
