## Rationale

By its nature, we're not sure a planning document like this can directly advance
Carbon's goals, but we think this roadmap does a good job of keeping us focused
on the work that will help us generate concrete evidence as to whether Carbon is
likely to successfully achieve those goals (and help us figure out how to
course-correct if it's not). Increasing the representation of non-Googlers on
the core team is an important indicator (as well as enabler) of building an
"open and inclusive community", not to mention of having a broad enough user
base to succeed, and the example ports, demo implementation, and executable
semantics will help us concretely evaluate how well Carbon is meeting all of its
language goals.

In addition, as the proposal argues, concrete evidence that Carbon can succeed
will indirectly help Carbon make faster progress, by motivating further
investment in the project. Some aspects of the roadmap will also help accelerate
Carbon's development in more direct ways. In particular, the executable
semantics implementation should enable Carbon contributors to rapidly prototype
potential new features, which will help us identify and solve more problems at
an earlier stage, and have higher confidence in the proposals we adopt.

While rapid progress is not an explicit goal of the Carbon project, Carbon can't
meet any of its other goals until it exists in a usable form, and the longer it
takes to reach that point, the less likely it is to reach it at all.
