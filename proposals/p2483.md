## Abstract

TODO: Describe, in a succinct paragraph, the gist of this document. This
paragraph should be reproduced verbatim in the PR summary.

## Problem

TODO: What problem are you trying to solve? How important is that problem? Who
is impacted by it?

-   The spelling of this keyword was an open question.
-   The `is` placeholder keyword we were using was unspecific.
-   Potentially want to use `is` as a keyword for another purpose.
-   `is` came from Swift (and others?) where `x is T` means "`x` has the type
    `T`", with the changes to Carbon generic semantics, particularly
    [#2360: Types are values of type `type`](https://github.com/carbon-language/carbon-lang/pull/2360),
    that is increasingly a poor fit for what we mean by this condition, which is
    closer to "`x` can be converted to `T` as a type."

## Background

TODO: Is there any background that readers should consider to fully understand
this problem and your approach to solving it?

The `is` keyword as a constraint operator was introduced in
[#818: Constraints for generics (generics details 3)](https://github.com/carbon-language/carbon-lang/pull/818),
along with the open question about how to spell it.

The choice of `is` in that proposal followed
[`is` being Swift's type check operator](https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/LanguageGuide/TypeCasting.html#ID340).
However note that the `is` operator in Swift is used for something different:
testing whether a value dynamically has a specific derived type, when you have a
value of a base class type and are using inheritance.

## Proposal

TODO: Briefly and at a high level, how do you propose to solve the problem? Why
will that in fact solve it?

## Details

TODO: Fully explain the details of the proposed solution.

## Rationale

-   Examples read naturally using `impls`, commonly matching how a comment would
    describe the constraint.
-   More clearly communicates the relationship between the two sides and that
    the relationship is not symmetric.
-   If a function has a `where T impls C` constraint that is not satisfied for
    some calling type `T`, the fix is for the caller to add an `impl T as C`
    definition.

TODO: How does this proposal effectively advance Carbon's goals? Rather than
re-stating the full motivation, this should connect that motivation back to
Carbon's stated goals and principles. This may evolve during review. Use links
