## Abstract

Provides a clear definition of our goals for the 0.1 Carbon language, and a
concrete feature-set that is expected to satisfy these goals.

The high level goal proposed for the 0.1 language is to reach an evaluation-MVP
(Minimal Viable Product): it should be sufficiently complete to evaluate its
suitability specifically with respect to fitness as a C++ successor language.

The features proposed for 0.1 language in turn focus on C++ interoperability and
a minimal subset of foundational aspects of the language.

Beyond the language itself, the other project features and milestones proposed
focus on enabling evaluation of the language design and interoperating with C++
in practice.

## Problem

The initial set of concrete goals for the Carbon project have focused on
establishing the project itself (governance, evolution, community,
infrastructure, etc.) and exploratory work on both the language design and
implementation.

The project is now reasonably healthy and executing effectively in the open, and
we've made enough exploratory progress on both design and implementation that we
need to pick a much more specific target to prioritize further work effectively.

The obvious next goal, as outlined in our 2023 roadmap, is to prepare Carbon for
detailed and in-depth evaluation by potential users to see if it could
potentially meet their needs for a C++ successor language. While some aspects of
our potential value proposition can be considered abstractly, many of the hard
questions around "will it work with my code?" and "how well will it work?" need
direct evaluation to gain confidence.

We need to prioritize a specific set of features and milestones that are
sufficient for this evaluation. Once this 0.1 language is "done" we can start
advocating for in-depth evaluation.

## Background

-   [Carbon's 2023 roadmap](https://github.com/carbon-language/carbon-lang/blob/trunk/docs/project/roadmap.md)

## Proposal

We suggest a set of initial milestones for the Carbon project with version
numbers to make them easy to talk about. For each milestone, we try to outline
what the theme is, provide some concrete goals that should be addressed, and a
list of concrete features we expect to be complete.

While the proposal only suggests three milestones initially, it isn't precluding
adding additional milestones when and where they make sense as the project
progresses.

This proposal is suggesting a concrete and near-complete set of features for the
first milestone. While this list may be updated based on new information, we are
reasonably confident in its completeness. However, subsequent milestones are
intentionally left incomplete and open-ended. They will be filled in as they get
closer. The intent in having them here is to allow us to explicitly defer things
to later milestones without leaving them out entirely in cases where there is
specific interest in knowing when a major feature is expected.

**Summary of proposed milestones:**

-   "0.1" -- the MVP (Minimum Viable Product) language for the _evaluation_ of
    Carbon by C++ community and developers.
-   "0.2" -- feature complete for evaluating and concluding the experiment
-   "1.0" -- the result of a successful experiment and production-ready

One important detail is that a core goal of Carbon is to be a language prepared
for on-going evolution. This means that even if Carbon gets to 1.0, that isn't
expected to be a _final_ version in any sense, nor is any version expected to be
final. Carbon should continue to evolve and develop going forward. As it gains
users, that evolution will have to be carefully managed to be easily adopted.
Eventually, there might be LTS (Long Term Stable) releases to help cover a wide
range of stability needs. All of this is part of the _actual_ requirement for
1.0: a concrete evolution strategy for Carbon.

## Details

This proposal adds a [milestones](/docs/project/milestones.md) document to the
Carbon project with the full details of the initial milestones.

## Rationale

TODO: How does this proposal effectively advance Carbon's goals? Rather than
re-stating the full motivation, this should connect that motivation back to
Carbon's stated goals and principles. This may evolve during review. Use links
to appropriate sections of [`/docs/project/goals.md`](/docs/project/goals.md),
and/or to documents in [`/docs/project/principles`](/docs/project/principles).

## Alternatives considered

What alternative solutions have you considered?

We break down the proposal into three parts: goals for 0.1, the 0.1 language,
and other milestones that will be important for the project as a whole to reach
0.1.
