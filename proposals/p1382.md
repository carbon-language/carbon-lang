## Problem

We've tried the `fn MethodName[me: Self]()` syntax for a while, and from our
experience the brevity of `me` is not worth doing something novel in this space.
We have found that `me` doesn't read well in practice.

## Background

The current method syntax, including these choices, was decided in
questions-for-leads issue
[#494: Method syntax](https://github.com/carbon-language/carbon-lang/issues/494).

Looking at other languages that use reserved word for the receiver value:

| Year       | Language   | Receiver when accessing members | Receiver value | Receiver type |
| ---------- | ---------- | ------------------------------- | -------------- | ------------- |
| 1983       | C++        | implicit                        | `this`         | ---           |
| 1991       | Python     | explicit                        | `self`         | ---           |
| 1995       | Java       | implicit                        | `this`         | ---           |
| 1995       | JavaScript | explicit                        | `this`         | ---           |
| 2000       | C#         | implicit                        | `this`         | ---           |
| 2009       | Go         | explicit                        | (see below)    | ---           |
| 2010       | Rust       | explicit                        | `self`         | `Self`        |
| 2011       | Kotlin     | implicit                        | `this`         | ---           |
| 2012       | TypeScript | explicit                        | `this`         | `this`        |
| 2014       | Swift      | implicit                        | `self`         | `Self`        |
| previously | Carbon     | explicit                        | `me`           | `Self`        |
| proposed   | Carbon     | explicit                        | `self`         | `Self`        |

In detail:

-   C++ uses
    [`this` for address of the receiver value](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/this)
-   Swift uses
    [`self` for the receiver value](https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/LanguageGuide/Methods.html#ID238).
    and
    [`Self` for its type](https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/ReferenceManual/Types.html#ID610).
-   Rust uses
    [`self` for the receiver value](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/keyword.self.html)
    and
    [`Self` for its type](https://doc.rust-lang.org/rust-by-example/fn/methods.html).
-   C# uses
    [`this` for a reference to the receiver value](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/keywords/this)
-   Python as a convention uses `self` for the receiver value, but it's almost
    universally followed.
-   Go conventionally uses an abbreviation of the type name.

## Proposal

Use `self` instead of `me` to be consistent with Swift and Rust.

## Rationale

This is consistent with Carbon's goal to make
[Code that is easy to read, understand, and write](/docs/project/goals.md#code-that-is-easy-to-read-understand-and-write)
by choosing a keyword for this role that is less surprising to users.

## Alternatives considered

We could stay with the status quo, though as the chart in
[the background section](#background) shows other languages have found it
acceptable to require a 4 character explicit keyword for accessing members of
the current object.

We could also switch to `this`, but we are worried that it frequently not being
a pointer would be surprising to the C++ users that choice would be intended to
benefit.
