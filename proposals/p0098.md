## Problem

Carbon will have two ways of letting users define product types: structs and
tuples. Structs are the more full-featured of the two; they may have names,
methods, etc. This proposal adds an initial design for structs.

## Proposal

We propose adding (`docs/design/structs.md`)[/docs/design/structs.md], which has
the details.
