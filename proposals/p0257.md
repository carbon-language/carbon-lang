## Problem

How should Carbon handle uninitialized memory and variables? There are a number
of goals we would like to satisfy in this space:

-   Minimize the overhead (in optimized builds) of unnecessary initialization.
-   Detect and diagnose bugs in code where variables are used without being
    initialized first at lower cost than a separate and unscalable build mode
    (MSan for C++).
-   Avoid the ergonomic and readability burden of being forced to initialize all
    variables at the point of declaration, even when there is no intentional
    value to yet use.
-   Minimize the security risk posed by accidental access of uninitialized
    memory.
-   Avoid unnecessary overhead for dynamic tracking of whether a variable is
    initialized.
-   Avoid unnecessarily running destructors for known uninitialized variables.
-   Allow most types similar ergonomics and behaviors as a simple machine
    integer type.
-   Offer similar behavior regardless of storage location (stack, heap,
    thread-local-storage, static / global storage).

Part of our goal is also to support code patterns such as:

```
  // At block scope of some function...
  var Int: temporary;
  while (...) {
    // ... code not using `temporary` ...

    temporary = ...;
    // ... code using `temporary` ...
  }
```

That is we also don't want to force a _syntactic_ distinction when an assignment
occurs to an already initialized variable. That would end up with fundamentally
similar ergonomic (and potentially performance) overheads as forcing
initialization as part of declaration. Throughout this document, the term
"assignment" should instead be understood as the operation that can be used in
this construct.

These problems are also tightly related to the problems of _moved-from_
semantics. These semantics might range from completely non-destructive (as in
C++) to completely destructive (as in Rust). A compelling solution for the
variable initialization challenges can also provide a compelling approach for
moved-from semantics that represents a middle ground between the two extremes
seen in C++ and Rust. For example, we propose that the following should hold
equally for moved-from objects and objects without an explicit initializer:

-   The object must not be used in any way other than assignment or destruction.
    -   Note that this doesn't say anything about taking the address which is
        orthogonal.
-   It must be possible to transition it to a valid, normal object through
    assignment.
-   It should be allowed to destroy them.
-   It should not be necessary to destroy them.

## Proposal

We propose two fundamental concepts:

1. An _unformed state_ for objects.
2. Raw, uninitialized storage.

The first of these is a new concept and is discussed in detail below. However,
uninitialized storage in Carbon should work in the same way as an uninitialized
array of `unsigned char` or `std::byte` in C++. This is intended primarily to
serve the needs of custom data structures such as C++'s `std::vector` or
whatever Carbon ends up with as an `Optional(T)` type. With such raw storage,
initialization and destruction of any objects within the storage must be managed
manually and externally and the language won't provide any automatic mechanisms.
The detailed syntax for working with raw storage in this manner is left to a
subsequent proposal.

### Unformed objects

An _unformed_ state is a state of an _object_. We both classify _objects_ based
on whether they are in an unformed state or a fully formed state, as well as
classify _types_ which support unformed states at all versus types that require
objects to always be in a fully formed state.

An unformed state for an object is one that satisfies the following properties:

-   Assignment to a fully formed value is correct using the normal assignment
    implementation for the type.
-   Destruction must be correct and a no-op using the type's normal destruction
    implementation.
-   Destruction must be optional. The behavior of the program must be equivalent
    whether the destructor is run or not for an unformed object, including not
    leaking resources.

Any operation on an unformed object _other_ than destruction or assignment to a
fully formed value is an **error**, including comparisons with other objects. It
should be diagnosed as early as possible in a debug build and at least at
runtime. In a performance build, it may lead to undefined behavior, but in a
hardened build we have a strong mitigation that restores safety by defining the
behavior using a maximally safe representation.

When a variable is declared without initialization, such as:

```
var Int: x;
```

The variable is implicitly initialized to its type's unformed state and
represents an unformed object.

It is invalid to declare a variable without explicit initialization unless its
type implements the interface to specify how to do that initialization. For
types that do not support initializing the variable to an unformed state, the
programmer must either explicitly initialize it to a valid and fully formed
state for the type, or must change the type to something like an `Optional(T)`
that introduces an unformed state (and the dynamic tracking necessary to
implement it) alongside raw storage for the underlying object.

#### Representation

This state can have the same representation as valid and fully formed states for
the object (for example, an empty `Optional(T)`). While there is a semantic
difference (any operation _other_ than assignment and destruction is an error
for an unformed object), there is no problem re-using a representation which is
also used for fully formed and valid objects provided it satisfies all three of
the above constraints. The semantic restrictions remain even in this case. Using
the hypothetical `Optional(T)` API, we could imagine:

```
var Optional(T): formed = .Empty;
// This is of course fine.
if (formed.empty()) { ... }

var Optional(T): unformed;
// This would be an error even though `unformed` might have identical
// in-memory representation or bit-pattern to `formed`:
if (unformed.empty()) { ... }
```

#### Address-of and escape

It is allowed to take the address of an unformed object and escape it to another
function. This function may even be responsible for assigning a fully formed
object to that location.

```
fn AssignIntTo(Int: x, Ptr(Int): destination) {
  *destination = x;
}

fn Example() {
  var Int: y;
  // `y` is unformed here.
  AssignIntTo(42, &y);
  // `y` is fully formed and usable.
}
```

This in turn is part of why it is important that the destructor is _allowed_ to
be run on an unformed object. This gives us a conservatively correct way to
implement code where it may be impossible to know whether the object has been
initialized to a fully formed object, and similarly code where it is impossible
to know whether the object has been moved-from. Consider some `HashMap`
container with allocated memory where the destructor _must_ be run to release
the memory:

```
fn MaybeInitializes(Ptr(HashMap): map);
fn MaybeMovesFrom(Ptr(HashMap): map);

fn Example() {
  var HashMap: map;
  MaybeInitializes(&map);
  if (...) {
    // Don't know if we need to destroy `map`. But conservatively we can run the
    // destructor unconditionally.
    return;
  }

  // Unconditionally assign a particular value to our map.
  map = ...;
  MaybeMovesFrom(&map);

  // `map` could be unformed (due to being moved from) or still fully formed.
  // Run the destructor unconditionally to be safe.
  return;
}
```

#### Types with an unformed state

The intent is that most types have an unformed state, as it will let types "be
like the `int`s" -- we design it to closely match how machine integers actually
behave in modern optimizing compilers: when left "uninitialized" they can be
safely _assigned_ or _destroyed_. But running the destructor is _optional_.

Types can opt into this semantic model and define an explicit operation to
create a type in the unformed state by implementing an interface. Because this
will be defined semantically by the existence of an implementation of the
relevant interface, and operationally by providing code to produce an unformed
object, there is no specific bit pattern or representation encoded for the
unformed state. The interface should provide a default implementation for types
where all members have an implementation which recurses member-wise.

It is reasonable to wonder if types where the default implementation is valid
implicitly implement the interface, or should it require an explicit opt-in?
Initially we suggest this should be explicit. There may grow to be a set of
interfaces which should be implicitly implemented due to their prevalence, but
it seems better to be conservative at first and approach that systematically.

Note that this state is similar but more restrictive than the _partially formed
state_ from Elements of Programming (EoP) in section 1.5.

#### Raw storage and padding

Raw storage and padding bytes are treated like they consist of unformed bytes.
Padding cannot ever be assigned to and thus will _always_ be unformed if
observed in any way. We propose not allowing sub-byte raw storage or padding.

### Necessary initialization

Some types will not provide an unformed state. Variables of such types must be
initialized when declared:

```
struct NecessaryInit {
  var Mutex m;

  // Potentially other members without a meaningful unformed state.
}

// This line would be an error:
var NecessaryInit: error_no_init;
```

For these types, the programmer must either explicitly initialize it to a valid
and fully formed state for the type, or must change the type to something like
an `Optional(T)` that introduces an unformed state (and the dynamic tracking
necessary to implement it) alongside raw storage for the underlying object:

```
// This is fine, it contains the boolean necessary to track initialization.
var Optional(NecessaryInit): ok;
```

### Optional features for unformed states

There are two _optional_ aspects of unformed states that types may elect to
explicitly specify (again by implementing interfaces, here by specializing the
implementation rather than relying on the default fallback).

#### Hardening initialization

First, types may specify how to further initialize an object that is in the
unformed state to harden it against erroneous usage. For example, the unformed
state of an `Int` is trivial -- it can simply be left uninitialized. However, it
can be hardened against bugs by setting it to zero. User defined types have the
option of specifying a specific routine to do similar hardening initialization.
Any storage for the type that is not specifically initialized by this routine
will be zeroed, including any padding.

#### Queryable unformed state

The second optional aspect is implementing a test for whether an object is
unformed. This test cannot be run by user code -- doing so would be a bug due to
referencing an unformed object. However, for types where the unformed state is
intrinsically distinct from any other state, they can expose the ability to
query this. That allows debug builds of Carbon to verify objects are fully
formed prior to use without external tracking state. Types which do not
implement this functionality will still get partial checking in debug builds
through external state, but may lose dynamic enforcement across ABI boundaries
where this extra state cannot be propagated. These are also the boundaries
across which the hardening will be done to ensure bugs across those boundaries
cannot become security vulnerabilities in the hardened build configuration.

### Function returns and initialization

This proposal also has implications for returning values from functions,
especially as it relates to how Carbon can provide something analogous to named
return values in a more principled form from what C++ does.

Consider the following common initialization code:

```
fn CreateMyObject() -> MyType {
  return <return-expression>;
}

var MyType: x = CreateMyObject();
```

We propose that the `&lt;return-expression>` in the `return` statement of
`CreateMyObject` _initializes_ the variable `x` here. There is no copy, etc. It
is precisely the same as:

```
var MyType: x = <return-expression>;
```

We also propose this applies _recursively_. This matches how C++ has evolved
with "guaranteed copy elision".

However, C++ has found that it is extremely desirable for functions to have the
same fundamental behavior apply for a _variable_ within a function rather than
just the expression in the `return` statement. We suggest that Carbon should
provide a direct mechanism for this with a named return variable which obeys the
same initialization rules as any other variable.

An important aspect of any approach to named return variables is that, much like
with normal return values, there is no copy when initializing. This means that
the address of `result` in the examples below of `CreateMyObject2` and
`CreateMyObject3` are the same as the address of `y` during the evaluation of
`y`'s initialization expression. Only one variable is created. It is first
initialized to an unformed state on entry to `CreateMyObject2` and assigned to a
fully formed value internally.

We see two possible approaches to achieve this: named return variable in place
of a return type, and declared `returned` variable.

#### Named return variable in place of a return type

With this approach, there is an alternate syntax for the return type which
declares a named variable that holds the return value. For example, provided
that `MyType` has an unformed state:

```
fn CreateMyObject2() -> var MyType: result {
  // `result` here is an unformed object.
  // so we can assign to it here:
  result = CreateMyObject();

  // Because there is a named return variable, we cannot
  // have an expression in the return statement.
  return;
}
```

We could also explicitly initialize the return variable, which eliminates the
requirement that its type has an unformed state:

```
fn CreateMyObject3() -> var MyType: result = CreateMyObject2() {
  // any code we want
  return;
}

var MyType: y = CreateMyObject3();
```

**Minor syntax variations:**

-   Possible to use different arrow symbols (such as `=>` instead of `->`) to
    differentiate different kinds of returns.
    -   However, we don't recommend this given the subtlety of the visual
        difference.
-   Potentially require `return &lt;name>;` where `&lt;name>` must exactly match
    the return variable's name to make it clear what is being returned.
    -   One concern with this is that `&lt;name>` can't really be an expression
        in general, it needs to _just_ be a name. This may be a bit surprising.
    -   Also complicated as there is no need to have a single name for the
        variable: it might be `var (MyType: result, Error: error)` for example,
        and it becomes unclear what to put in the `return`.

#### Declared `returned` variable

Another approach is to allow a specific variable within the function body to be
declared as `returned` from the function. Again assuming that `MyType` has an
unformed state, the alternative to the above syntax would be:

```
fn CreateMyObject2() -> MyType {
  returned var MyType: result;
  // Any code we want here.

  result = CreateMyObject();

  // No expression in the return statement here either.
  return;
}
```

And again we can initialize the return variable to remove the partially formed
requirement:

```
fn CreateMyObject3() -> MyType {
  // Any code we want here.

  returned var MyType: result = CreateMyObject();

  // Potentially more code...
  return;
}
```

Minor syntax variations:

-   As above, potentially require `return &lt;name>;` where `&lt;name>` is
    constrained to match the declared variable name.
    -   Has the same fundamental concerns as above: it's not an expression, and
        there might not _be_ a single name.
    -   If there were good syntax, might be particularly valuable to help with
        scoping?
-   Maybe better syntax than `returned var`, open to suggestions here.

A significant advantage of this approach is that it makes initializing the
variable _much_ more clean and convenient. There is code that can run prior to
the initialization, etc. This makes it a substantially more ergonomic solution
for types without an unformed state.

If we pursue this direction, we may want to generalize it to non-`var`
declarations, it doesn't seem like there would be any significant problem with
that and it would seem like a clean generalization of the construct.

One open question is what rules should be used for the types in the pattern, and
to what degree they must match the return type. A simple approach would be that
whatever type would be the _allocated_ type of the variable must match the
return type, and allow any pattern that satisfies this rule. This would, for
example, allow potentially binding names in interesting and useful ways.
However, there are other possibilities:

-   Require the pattern to consist of a single type exactly matching the return,
    and binding it to a single name.
-   Require using a placeholder type with a keyword (syntactically similar to
    `auto`) that is replaced with the return type. This might even provide the
    syntax (`var return: result1;`).
-   Use a custom type-less pattern syntax.

None of these dramatically change the resulting design tradeoffs, but we will
need to make a decision on which strategy to use.

Control flow presents some challenging questions for this design. Consider code
with the following structure:

```
fn ReturnEitherOr(...) -> MyType {
  // ...
  if (...) {
    returned var MyType: result1 = ...;
    // ...
    return;
  } else if (...) {
    returned var MyType: result2 = ...;
    // ...
  } else {
    returned var MyType: result3 = ...;
    // ...
  }
  // ...
  return;
}
```

It seems like at least `result1` should be valid. What about `result2` and
`result3`? Theoretically we could make this work in some cases, but it requires
enumerating all of paths through the function and ensuring all contain a
`returned var`. We would also need to reject cases where such an enumeration
isn't possible.

More complex control flow patterns grow the complexity this presents. For
example:

```
fn ReturnVarWithControlFlow() -> Point {
  if ... {
    // Is this allowed?
    returned var Point: p1 = ...;

    if ... {
      // This seems fine to return `p1`.
      return;
    }
  }
  if ... {
    // But this would have to be an error...
    return;
  }

  // And what happens here?
  returned var Point: p2 = ...;

  for ... {
    // Or here?
    returned var Point: p3 = ...;

    // Even though we might actually return...
    if ... {
      return;
    }
  }
  // Definitely no way to know what happens here between p1, p2, and p3.
  return;
}
```

We can add restrictions to end up with a reasonable set of rules here. The
restrictions seem unlikely to be a problem in practice with real world code
using this tool. However, it may result in a surprisingly restricted language
construct compared to others, or surprising usability gaps.

One candidate set of restrictions that is reasonably simple to explain and
understand and is at least sufficient for implementation:

1. The only way to exit a scope after a `returned var` declaration is by way of
   a `return`.
2. At most one `returned var` declaration can exist within a scope.

These rules are fairly restrictive, but might still be sufficient for practical
usage. We might at least be able to start with these rules and see how far they
get. It would make all of `result2`, `result3`, `p1`, and `p3` invalid in the
above examples.

A major open question is whether the ergonomic benefits of declared return
variables outweigh the complexity of handling how they interact with control
flow.

### Constructors and initializing aggregate objects

Constructors of user defined aggregate types can present specific problems with
initialization because they intrinsically operate on types prior to all of their
invariants being established and when a valid value may not (yet) exist for
subobjects such as members. These problems are discussed in detail in the blog
post
["Perils of Constructors"](https://matklad.github.io/2019/07/16/perils-of-constructors.html).
A primary goal in trying to solve these problems is being able to separate the
phase of initializing members (or other kinds of subobjects) prior to the outer
object existing and establishing any necessary invariants without creating holes
in the type system soundness. An interconnected problem is correctly running
destructors (in order to release any acquired resources) in the event of errors
_during_ construction.

The behavior of function returns provides interesting build blocks to write code
that addresses these problems. They provide a natural set of tools to build two
phases of a constructor: code that executes before a valid object exists and
code that executes afterward. It even gives a clear demarcation between these
phases. Both replacing the return type with a named variable and adding
`returned` variable declarations are effective building blocks for solving these
problems.

An example with the named return variable:

```
struct Point {
  var Int: x;
  var Int: y;
}

fn PointConstructorPreObjectPhase() -> Point {
  // Code that runs prior to an object existing.
  // Just assembles inputs needed to initialize the members.
  return (<x-expression>, <y-expression>);
}

fn PointConstructor -> var Point: p = PointConstructorPreObjectPhase() {
  // Code that runs after an object exists.
  // A failure here would, for example, require destroying p.
  return;
}
```

The unformed state allows a simpler formulation of the same concept for types
supporting it:

```
fn SimplerPointConstructor -> var Point: p {
  // `p` is unformed. We don't need to destroy it, but we can if convenient.
  // Code can run here to assemble the members:
  var Int: x_init = ...;
  var Int: y_init = ...;

  // And we can express the demarcation with an assignment.
  p = (x_init, y_init);
  // `p` is now fully formed, and its destructor *must* run.

  // More code that uses p can go here.
  return;
}
```

An example with `returned` variable declarations shows how that approach brings
similar ergonomics as the unformed example above without relying on an unformed
state:

```
fn PointConstructorWithDeclaredReturnVar() -> Point {
  // Code that runs prior to an object existing.
  returned var Point: p = (<x-expression>, <y-expression>);
  // `p` is now a fully formed object, its destructor must run.

  // More code that uses p can go here.
  return;
}
```

Using the `returned` variable declarations may also make the semantics more
clear (or potentially avoid some copies of intermediate state) even for types
with an unformed state.

#### Unformed members

Regardless of which specific strategy is used above, using these facilities for
constructing aggregate objects still presents some ergonomic difficulties for
large objects with many members, or members that are expensive/impossible to
move if we don't have the `returned var` facility. To further ease initializing
members, we could allow access to unformed members of an unformed object.
Superficially, this remains safe -- we aren't allowing access to uninitialized
storage, and the only access allowed is what is always allowed for unformed
objects: assignment (and destruction). However, making this work with
destructors adds some complexity to rules around unformed objects.

Disallowing access to unformed members provides a simple rule for the semantics
required of the destructor: it must be valid and correct to run on an unformed
object or a _fully_ formed object. Destructors always have to be valid for fully
formed objects, so the only addition is the unformed state being a no-op.

However, for the same reasons it might be necessary to run the destructor on an
unformed object, if we allow assigning to a _member_ of an unformed object the
destructor may also need to be run with this mixed state where some members are
unformed and others are fully formed:

```
struct Point {
  var Int: x;
  var Int: y;
}

fn AssignToX(Int: x, Ptr(Point): p) {
  p->x = x;
}

fn Example() {
  var Point: p;
  if (...) {
    // Allowed to call the destructor of `p`, sees a fully unformed `Point`.
    return;
  }
  AssignToX(42, &p);
  if (...) {
    // If `AssignToX` is in another file, don't know if `p` is fully unformed,
    // a mixture of `x` fully formed and `y` unformed, or `p` is fully formed.
    // The last case can only be handled by running the destructor of `p`
    // so that's what we have to do here, and it must handle all the other
    // cases as well.
    return;
  }
  p->y = 13;
  // ...
}
```

The added requirement for destructors of types that support an unformed state is
that if they are called for an unformed object of that type, they must run the
destructors for any members that might themselves be fully formed.

-   For private members, the type itself controls which members might be
    assigned fully formed values and the destructor run. The type's destructor
    merely needs to agree with the constructors and/or factories of the type to
    destroy any members that might have been assigned values.
-   For public members, the type's destructor must destroy _all_ members as it
    cannot know which ones might have been assigned a value.

Because of these inherent restrictions around private members, types can ensure
any necessary relationship between its private data members hold in order for
the destructor to work. See the detailed example below for how this might work
in practice.

Despite these added requirements to the destructor, it isn't exempt from the
rules governing unformed objects when accessing its members: any that are in
fact unformed when the type's destructor runs are only allowed to be assigned to
or destroyed.

Lastly, we need some syntax other than assignment for marking when the members
have reached a state where the entire object is fully formed. This proposal uses
a hypothetical `?reify?` statement that is intended to be placeholder syntax
only. Just like an assignment to an unformed object, after this point it is
fully formed and follows those rules. Our example becomes:

```
fn EvenSimplerPointConstructor() -> var Point: p {
  // p is unformed and no members are referenced.
  // Destruction is completely optional.
  p.x = ...;
  // p.x may now be fully formed. Either p must be destroyed,
  // or p.x must be destroyed.
  p.y = ...;
  // Now either p must be destroyed, or both p.x and p.y must be
  // destroyed.

  ?reify? p;
  // Now p must be destroyed, and is a fully formed object.

  // ...

  return;
}
```

Before the `?reify?` operation, the compiler can either track the members which
are assigned fully formed values and run their destructors, or it can elect to
run the entire object's destructor if, for example, the entire object escapes
and it becomes impossible to track which members have been assigned fully formed
values. But once the object has the `?reify?` operation performed, its
destructor _must_ be run as it is now itself a fully formed object.

Now that we have all the components of this tool, let's consider a container
like `std::vector` using a hypothetical syntax for defining a type, its
implementation of the necessary initialization, its destructor, and a factory
function. This example specifically tries to illustrate how, for private
members, the function doing construction and the destructor can work together to
ensure at any point of destruction, the necessary state and invariants hold.

```
struct MyContainer(Type: T) {
  private var Int: size;
  private var Int: capacity;
  private var Optional(Ptr(T)): data;

  // ... public API ...

  impl NecessaryInit {
    // Not necessarily suggesting this specific API.
    // Just *some* API we pick for doing the necessary init.
    // This API assumes that all members with an unformed state
    // have their implementation called already, all we need to do is
    // adjust to *specific* values anything that is necessary for this
    // type.
    fn Init(Ptr(Self): this) {
      this->data = Optional(Ptr(T)).Empty;
    }
  }

  fn Create(Int: count, T: value) -> Optional(MyContainer(T)) {
    var MyContainer(T): container;
    // Set the capacity first so it is available for deallocation.
    container.capacity = count;
    // And clear the size so we don't need a special case.
    container.size = 0;

    // Next set the data to the allocated buffer. If the allocation fails,
    // this routine should just return null.
    container.data = AllocateRawStorage(count, T);
    if (container.data == null) {
      // Might destroy `container` here.
      return .Empty;
    }

    // Some loop syntax over [0, count).
    for (Int: i = 0 ..< count) {
      if (not CopyThatMightFail(value, &container.data[i])) {
        // Might destroy `container` here.
        return .Empty;
      }
      // Increment size as we go to track how many objects
      // need to be destroyed if the next one fails.
      ++container.size;
    }

    ?reify? container;

    // Maybe we make this implicit... somehow make it move...
    return .Some(container);
  }

  // However we end up naming this...
  fn Destructor(Ptr(Self): this) {
    if (this->data.IsEmpty()) {
      // If the buffer isn't allocated, nothing to do.
      return;
    }
    // Destroy any successfully created object. The `Create`
    // function ensures that `size` is valid for use here.
    for (Int: i = 0 ..< this->size) {
      // However we spell in-place destroy...
      this->data[i].Destructor();
    }
    // Deallocate the buffer. Here as well the `Create`
    // function ensures that `capacity` is available for a
    // non-null data pointer.
    Deallocate(this->data, this->capacity);
  }
}
```

This kind of type creates a close contract between construction and destruction
to simplify both routines by ensuring that the necessary members are valid any
time the destructor would need them to continue executing correctly.

While this provides a very flexible and convenient set of tools for
construction, it comes at a fairly high cost. There is no way for the language
to _enforce_ any contract between the construction and destruction. I don't see
any way to provide compile time checking that one or the other doesn't make a
mistake. We can verify it dynamically, but at fairly high cost. It also adds
non-trivial complexity. Given that this is merely an ergonomic improvement as
opposed to an expressivity improvement, it isn't at all clear that we should
pursue this until we have clear evidence that the ergonomic need is sufficiently
large.

In fact, for this kind of realistic example, the `returned` variable approach
appears to be significantly _more_ ergonomic as well as simpler, undermining the
purpose of pursing this direction:

```
struct MyContainer(Type: T) {
  private var Int: size;
  private var Int: capacity;
  private var Optional(Ptr(T)): data;

  // ... public API ...

  impl NecessaryInit {
    // Not necessarily suggesting this specific API.
    // Just *some* API we pick for doing the necessary init.
    // This API assumes that all members with an unformed state
    // have their implementation called already, all we need to do is
    // adjust to *specific* values anything that is necessary for this
    // type.
    fn Init(Ptr(Self): this) {
      this->data = Optional(Ptr(T)).Empty;
    }
  }

  // Private helper factored out of the destructor.
  fn DestroyElements(Ptr(T): data, Int: count) {
    for (Int: i = 0 ..< count) {
      data[i].Destructor();
    }
  }

  fn Create(Int: count, T: value) -> Optional(MyContainer(T)) {
    // Try to allocate the storage.
    var UniquePtr(T): data = AllocateRawStorage(count, T);
    if (data == null) {
      return .Empty;
    }

    // Some loop syntax over [0, count).
    for (Int: i = 0 ..< count) {
      if (not CopyThatMightFail(value, &container.data[i])) {
        // Here we have to destroy the copies that succeeded.
        // But we can easily share the logic with the destructor.
        DestroyElements(data, i);
        return .Empty;
      }
    }

    // Now we can just initialize the object and all invariants
    // hold for its destructor.
    returned var MyContainer(T): container = (count, count, data);

    return .Some(container);
  }

  // However we end up naming this...
  fn Destructor(Ptr(Self): this) {
    if (this->data.IsEmpty()) {
      // If the buffer isn't allocated, nothing to do.
      return;
    }
    // The above check is the only thing needed, and it is only needed
    // to support an unformed state. Once we get here, everything holds.
    DestroyElements(this->data, this->size);
    Deallocate(this->data, this->capacity);
  }

}
```

With this approach, the necessary steps in the `Create` function are all _local_
constraints, and changes to the destructor can't break their assumptions. There
is no significant added complexity in practice due to needing to form the entire
object at a single point. Normal techniques for factoring common logic are
easily used to address what little added logic is needed.

Note that inheritance opens a set of closely related but also importantly
different concerns as members here.

## Open questions

All of the open questions are discussed in more detail as part of the proposal,
but are called out here to make it clear that these need to be independently
decided.

### Named return variable, declared `returned` variables, or both?

Advantages of named return variable:

-   Simple and unambiguous approach.
-   Difficult to misuse.
-   Obvious rules.

Disadvantages of named return variable:

-   Weirdly overloads the return type.
    -   Probably not part of the signature, especially the _name_, but
        positioned there.
-   Significantly less flexible than
    [NRVO](https://www.digitalmars.com/d/2.0/glossary.html#nrvo) in C++.
-   Ergonomics are really bad for types without an unformed state.

Advantages of declared `returned` variables:

-   Very natural syntax.
-   Expressive enough to handle lots of interesting NRVO-like cases.
-   Excellent ergonomics for complex construction including types without an
    unformed state.

Disadvantages of declared `returned` variables:

-   Somewhat complex constraints on how and where they can be used.
    -   However, this doesn't seem likely to come up frequently or be surprising
        for users. The complexity seems mostly confined to the specification and
        implementation.
-   Syntax appears to be _much_ more general than it is in reality. No obvious
    syntactic reinforcement of the inherent restrictions.

It would be possible to have both, but it's unclear why we would want named
return variables which are mostly less ergonomic if we're willing to get
declared `returned` variables.

### Allow accessing member access of unformed objects?

TODO: write up an advantage/disadvantage summary.

### Allow assigning an unformed object to another unformed object?

Advantages:

-   Avoids surprise for users.
    -   It seems like it should work for integers.
    -   They may not know when the incoming object is actually unformed
        resulting in an error far away from the root cause.
-   May be important to enable specific code patterns if we allow member access.

Disadvantages:

-   Will require the core propagation logic and origin tracking that is a source
    of large complexity and cost in MSan to detect bugs.
    -   However, object granularity and lack of arithmetic makes this still
        somewhat less severe than what MSan deals with.
    -   Only a concern for detection, hardening is easily accomplished
        regardless.
-   Can only possibly support combined debug build mode if restricted to a
    special/designated operation rather than arbitrary assignment.
    -   Origin tracking will still be required and have significant cost.

Proposed decision: **not yet.**

-   We should try _not_ allowing this at first.
-   If we find we must allow this in some cases, we should start by allowing it
    only using specially named operations.
-   If either can be made to work, they are significantly easier to check for
    bugs.

## Alternatives considered

### Require compile-time-proven initialization

A primary alternative to the approach of unformed objects for initialization is
to simply require initializing all variables at compile time. This can take a
few forms across the spectrum of compile time analysis complexity.

#### Trivially required initialization

The simplest approach is to require initialization at the point of declaration
or allocation for any variable or memory.

Advantages:

-   No need to specify or support the complexity of objects that have been
    declared but not fully initialized in the language.
-   Simple, easy to teach, easy to implement.

Disadvantages:

-   Will result in initialization with nonsensical values that if used remain a
    bug. We won't have any realistic way to detect these bugs.
-   Imposes a non-trivial performance cost in some cases and for some users
    without providing any effective mechanisms to address this overhead.

#### Initialize on all branches prior to use (Rust)

Use a simple rule such as requiring initialization before use along all
branches.

Advantages:

-   Still avoids much of the language level complexity of unformed objects.
-   Very simple to implement.
-   Reasonably teachable.
-   Avoids trivially redundant initializations.

Disadvantages:

-   Has significant expressivity limits past which initialization is forced.
    -   When this happens, the disadvantages of always requiring initialization
        repeat. While it is expected to happen less often, it still happens.

#### Definitive initialization (Swift)

We could do significantly more complete analysis of the dataflow of the program
to prove that initialization occurs prior to use.

Advantages:

-   Still avoids much of the language level complexity of unformed objects.

Disadvantages:

-   Some implementation complexity to achieve strong dataflow analysis.
-   Significant complexity to teach -- it can be difficult to understand or
    explain why the data flow analysis fails in edge cases.
-   Can result in brittleness where changes to one part of code confuse the
    dataflow analysis needed by another part of code.
-   There still exist rare cases where the analysis fails, and a nonsensical
    initialization may be required and the disadvantages of those return (both
    bug detection and performance).
    -   The rate at which this occurs scale inversely proportional to the
        complexity of the data flow analysis and the teachability.

### C/C++ uninitialized

We could pursue the same approach as C and C++ here. However, this path has
proven to have severe problems. It has inevitably resulted in prevalent bugs and
security vulnerabilities due to programmer errors, And having uninitialized
variables in the language makes teaching the debug build to catch these bugs
extremely difficult and potentially impossible. We essentially will need
developers to heavily use an MSan-like mode (either by integrating it with the
debug build or having a separate one) in order to cope with the bugs caused by
uninitialized memory. This is the only thing that has allowed coping with C/C++
semantics here and even it is not very effective.

If MSan remains a separate tool that needs propagation and origin tracking
([details](https://research.google.com/pubs/archive/43308.pdf)), the cost and
the barrier to entry will remain very high: MSan is currently the least used and
the least portable of the sanitizers; it is widely used only in two Google’s
ecosystems, only on one OS, where it is maintained with a considerable effort.

If we end up having uninitialized memory, we should aim at having MSan-like
checking be part of the normal debug build, which means no or very limited
propagation. Any form of propagation will require optional original tracking,
which is doable, but will mean extra CPU/RAM overhead for meaningful
diagnostics.

Even without propagation, MSan-like checking requires bit-to-bit shadow, that is
will generally incur 2x RAM overhead in the debug build. Byte-to-bit shadow
(that is &lt; 12% RAM overhead) is prone to racy false positives and false
negatives unless a) instrumentation uses expensive bit-wise atomics or b) the
language defines data races on 8-byte granularity (this idea has been rejected
in the early stages of Carbon design)

### Fully destructive move (Rust)

Rust has truly destructive moves -- the object is gone after being moved from,
and no destructor ever runs past that point. This is possible because the type
system models when a variable declared in one function can be moved-from by
another function. It is incompatible with allowing move-from through a pointer
to a non-local object.

Advantages:

-   Precise, safe, and efficient lifetime management.
-   Perfect detection of use-after-move bugs.

Disadvantages:

-   Doesn't compose with pointers and C++ idioms which involve moving out of
    non-local objects through a pointer.
    -   Would require redesigning systems to model the lifetime in the type
        system.

### Completely non-destructive move (C++)

C++ moves are never destructive. The result is that moves simply do not impact
the _lifetime_ of the moved-from object, only its state.

Advantages:

-   Perfect match for C++ semantics and idioms, including interoperability and
    migrated code and systems.

Disadvantages:

-   Pervasive user expectation that destroying a moved-from object is a no-op,
    but nothing in the language helps enforce this pattern.
-   Allows types to provide meaningful semantics for use-after-move.
    -   Rarely used, resulting in strong user expectations that this isn't
        allowed but special cases where it is allowed.
    -   Complicates generic code having to handle both patterns.
    -   Significantly reduces the effectiveness of use-after-move bug detection.
-   Introduces difficulty in optimizing away no-op destruction post move.
    -   Some cases requires complex rules around ABIs and calling conventions.
    -   Other cases require expensive optimization techniques (inlining and
        memory analysis) that can fail in some circumstances.
