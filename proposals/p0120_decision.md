## Open questions

None.

## Rationale

This addresses a number of rough edges and small missing pieces in the original
proposal, providing useful clarification. This follow up is expected as part of
the launch and iterate process we use to keep our velocity up.

User-facing documentation and speed-by-default should be first-order priorities
for Carbon.
