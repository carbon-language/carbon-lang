## Abstract

Change terminology from "generics" and "templates" to "checked generics" and
"template generics". Afterwards, "generics" will be an umbrella term that
include templates.

## Problem

The C++ community does "generic programming" using templates in C++, and so
thinks of templates as a mechanism for implementing generics. In Carbon,
templates and other generic features are more similar than they are different,
so it is worthwhile to have an easy way to talk about things that apply to both.

## Proposal

Change terminology from "generics" and "templates" to "checked generics" and
"template generics". Afterwards, "generics" will be an umbrella term that
include templates.

The [generics overview](/docs/design/generics/overview.md), for example,
currently demonstrates the current approach of using "generics" and "templates".
The [generics section of the design overview](/docs/design/README.md#generics)
demonstrates the use of the proposed new terminology.

## Rationale

Using the terminology expected by the community supports these goals:

-   [Code that is easy to read, understand, and write](/docs/project/goals.md#code-that-is-easy-to-read-understand-and-write)
-   [Interoperability with and migration from existing C++ code](/docs/project/goals.md#interoperability-with-and-migration-from-existing-c-code)
