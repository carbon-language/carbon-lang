## Problem

Carbon needs a coherent, consistent approach to handling and propagating errors.

**Question for reviewers:** Do we need to say more here? If so, what?

## Background

**Question for reviewers:** What kind of background does this proposal need, if
anything?

## Proposal

I propose establishing as a design principle that Carbon's error handling will
be based on return values, and specifically return values of sum types, rather
than exceptions or other non-return side channels.

## Alternatives considered

### Decouple errors from return values

Rather than representing errors using function return values, we could convey
errors by way of a separate "channel", as in Swift. This would require a
separate syntax for indicating whether a function can raise errors, and unless
we want to follow Swift in making errors dynamically typed, that syntax would
also need to indicate the type of those errors. We would additionally need a
separate syntax for stopping error propagation and resuming normal control flow,
such as Swift's `do`/`catch`, because the error "channel" is invisible to
ordinary code.

This approach may have some performance advantages, because the compiler always
statically knows whether a given object represents an error or a successful
return value, although it's not clear how significant that advantage will be in
Carbon.

This approach will make it harder for Carbon code to interoperate with C++ code
that uses error returns, and harder to migrate such code to Carbon. It might be
an easier migration/interoperation target for C++ code that uses exceptions, but
that's less certain, because this approach still differs from C++ exceptions in
fairly important ways, such as the fact that typing is static and propagation is
explicit. By the same token, this approach is somewhat less likely to feel
familiar to C++ programmers.

I recommend against this approach for the present, because the need for
something like `do`/`catch` makes it more complex to design, and because the
potential advantages, particularly with respect to performance, are fairly
speculative. It seems better to start with the simpler approach, and let
subsequent design changes be driven by concrete experience with whatever
problems it has.

### Implicit error propagation

As an extension of the previous option, we could treat errors as a separate
channel from return values, and allow them to propagate across stack frames
implicitly, without an explicit `?` or `try` at the callsite. This is basically
how C++ exceptions work, so this would ease migration and interoperation with
C++ code that uses them. However, this would make Carbon code substantially less
readable and harder to maintain, because it would introduce control-flow paths
that are entirely invisible to the reader. A very large fraction of the C++
community has rejected use of exceptions, in large part for those reasons. Those
engineers and organizations would be much less likely to adopt Carbon if we took
this approach.
