## Rationale

-   Some comment syntax is necessary to support software evolution, readable and
    understandable code, and many other goals of Carbon.
-   A single, simple, and consistent comment style supports Carbon's goal of
    easy to read and understand code, and fast development tools.
-   The experiment of restricting comments to be the only non-whitespace text on
    a line supports Carbon's goal of software evolution.
-   The careful open lexical space left supports Carbon's goal of language
    evolution.
-   The use of `//` as the primary syntax marking comments supports
    interoperability with C++-trained programmers and codebases by avoiding
    unnecessary and unhelpful churn of comment syntax.
