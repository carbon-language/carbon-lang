## Abstract

This proposal updates the design of [p0157](p0157.md) to reflect subsequent
evolution of the language.

## Problem

The design of p0157 has become inconsistent with the rest of the language.

## Proposal

-   Use `name: Type` order instead of `Type: name` order in alternative
    declarations.
-   Use current syntax and semantics for generics and class types.
-   Rename `Matchable.Match` to `Match.Op`, following the resolution of
    [#1058](https://github.com/carbon-language/carbon-lang/issues/1058).
