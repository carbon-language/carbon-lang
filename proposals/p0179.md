## Problem

The development of a toolchain for Carbon needs a team of people to oversee it.
This will primarily involve code reviews and ensuring the quality of the end
toolcahin, and includes significant work around compile time efficiency as well
as developing a cohesive set of libraries for use in developer tools and other
contexts.

## Background

This is largely a technical team that can fluidly evolve over time as people
have time and energy to commit to developing the toolchain's codebase itself.

## Proposal

Create a team from initial volunteers and evolve it over time based on who ends
up contributing. Notably, contributions can be to the design, documentation, and
code _review_ in addition to code or patches themeselves.

### Scope

Beyond the traditional components of a language toolchain, this team should also
cover any needed code review and/or oversight for other implementation efforts
within the Carbon project, such as supporting tools and test suites related to
the language itself.

There may be some overlap between this _language_ infrastructure and the
_project_ infrastructure covered by the
[admins](/docs/project/groups.md#admins). This propsoal doesn't suggest a hard
deliniation between these, and if in doubt and/or there is disagreement it
should simply be escalated to the [core team](/docs/project/groups.md#core-team)
rather than spending too much time defining precisely disjoint scopes.
