## Problem

The development of a toolchain for Carbon needs a team of people to oversee it.
This will primarily involve code reviews and ensuring the quality of the end
toolcahin, and includes significant work around compile time efficiency as well
as developing a cohesive set of libraries for use in developer tools and other
contexts.

## Background

This is largely a technical team that can fluidly evolve over time as people
have time and energy to commit to developing the toolchain's codebase itself.

## Proposal

Create a team from initial volunteers and evolve it over time based on who ends
up contributing. Notably, contributions can be to the design, documentation, and
code _review_ in addition to code or patches themeselves.
