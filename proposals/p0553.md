## Problem

We want to Carbon to have a high quality generics feature that achieves the
goals set out in [#24](https://github.com/carbon-language/carbon-lang/pull/24).
This is too big to land in a single proposal. This proposal goes into the
details of the core of the feature, and provides an outline covering future
work. It covers:

-   interfaces
-   implementing interfaces for types
-   resolving name conflicts
-   facet types
-   type-types as the way of describing type variables
-   structural interfaces
-   combining interfaces
-   interface requirements and extension
-   type compatibility

## Background

This is a follow on to these previous generics proposals:

-   [Generics goals #24](https://github.com/carbon-language/carbon-lang/pull/24)
-   [Generics terminology #447](https://github.com/carbon-language/carbon-lang/pull/447)
-   [Generics overview #524](https://github.com/carbon-language/carbon-lang/pull/524)

The content for this proposal was extracted from a larger
[Generics combined draft proposal](https://github.com/carbon-language/carbon-lang/pull/36).

## Proposal

This is a proposal to add
[this detailed design document](/docs/design/generics/details.md).

## Rationale based on Carbon's goals

Much of this rationale was captured in the
[Generics goals proposal](https://github.com/carbon-language/carbon-lang/pull/24).

## Alternatives considered

Alternatives considered will be in a future proposal. Some of them can be seen
in a rough form in
[#36](https://github.com/carbon-language/carbon-lang/pull/36).
