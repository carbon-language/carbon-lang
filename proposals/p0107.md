## Problem

How do developers store code for the compiler, and access it for reuse?

## Proposal

Adopt an approach with tiered files, libraries, packages and namespaces in the
design.

### Out-of-scope issues

Related issues that are out-of-scope for this proposal are:

-   Access control: while there is some implicit access control from interface
    vs implementation considerations for libraries, they are more about
    addressing circular dependencies in code.

-   Aliasing implementation: while the `alias` keyword is critical to how easy
    or difficult refactoring is, it should be designed on its own.

-   Compilation details: this proposal sets up a framework that should enable
    well-designed compilation, but does not set about to design how compilation
    will work.

-   File-private identifiers: Something similar to C++ `static` functions may
    exist. However, that will be addressed separately.

-   Incremental migration and unused imports: incrementally migrating a
    declaration from one library to another might require an intermediate state
    where callers import both libraries, with consequent issues. However, it may
    also not require such. Whether it does, or whether tooling needs to be added
    to support the specific intermediary state of transitional, unused imports,
    is out of scope.

-   Name lookup, including addressing conflicting names between imports and
    names in the current file: the name lookup design is likely to address this
    better, including offering syntax that could refer to it if needed.

    -   After discussion, we believe we do not need to support package renaming.
        However, that final decision should be based on name lookup addressing
        the issue, as implications need to be considered more deeply.

-   Package management: while we want to choose syntax that won't impose
    barriers on building package management into Carbon, we should not make
    assumptions about how package management should work.

-   Prelude package, or fundamentals: while we've discussed how to handle name
    lookup for things like `Int32`, this proposal mainly lays out a framework
    where options for addressing that are possible.

This proposal should not be interpreted as addressing these issues. A separate
discussion of these issues will remain necessary.

## Open questions for the decision

Extended open question comparisons may be found in
[the examples doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1J8GX9uw5AxBz5Q22MLHJOfzLq4WJqKL-q1VwnKGHG-k/edit#)
in addition to the `code_and_organization.md` alternatives section.

### Should we switch to a library-oriented structure that's package-agnostic?

**Decision:** No.

Right now, the `package` syntax is very package-oriented. We could instead
eliminate package semantics from code and organization, relying only on
libraries and removing the link to distribution. This is the
[collapse the package concept into libraries](#collapse-the-package-concept-into-libraries)
alternative.

Does the core team agree with the approach to packages and libraries? If not,
does the alternative capture what the core team wants to be turned into the
proposal, or is some other approach preferred?

### Should there be a tight association between file paths and packages/libraries?

**Decision:** Make paths correspond to libraries for API files, not impl files.
Keep `package`.

Right now, the `package` syntax requires the package's own name be repeated
through code. This touches on a couple alternatives:

-   Strict association between the file system path and library/namespace
-   [Referring to the package as `package`](#referring-to-the-package-as-package)

The end result of taking both alternatives would be that:

-   The `package` and `library` would no longer need to be specified on the
    first line.
    -   The `import` would still need a `library`.
-   The `package` keyword would always be used to refer to the current package.
    -   Referring to the current package by name would be disallowed, to allow
        for easier renames of conflicting package names.

## Justification

-   [Software and language evolution](/docs/project/goals.md#software-and-language-evolution):

    -   The syntax and interactions between `package` and `import` should enable
        moving code between files and libraries with fewer modifications to
        callers, easing maintenance of large codebases.

        -   In C++ terms, `#include` updates are avoidable when moving code
            around.

-   [Code that is easy to read, understand, and write](/docs/project/goals.md#code-that-is-easy-to-read-understand-and-write):

    -   By setting up imports so that each name in a file is unique and refers
        to the source package, we make the meaning of symbols clear and easier
        to understand.

    -   The proposed `namespace` syntax additionally makes it clear when the
        package's default namespace is not being used.

        -   This is in contrast to C++ namespaces, where the entire body of code
            above the line of code in question may be used to start a namespace.

    -   Clearly marking interfaces will make it easier for both client code and
        IDE tab completion to more easily determine which APIs can be used from
        a given library.

-   [Fast and scalable development](/docs/project/goals.md#fast-and-scalable-development):

    -   The structure of libraries and imports should help enable separate
        compilation, particularly improving performance for large codebases.

-   [Interoperability with and migration from existing C++ code](/docs/project/goals.md#interoperability-with-and-migration-from-existing-c-code):

    -   The syntax of `import` should enable extending imports for use in
        interoperability code.

## Alternatives considered

### Packages

#### Name paths for package names

Right now, we only allow a single identifier for the package name. We could
allow a full name path without changing syntax.

Advantages:

-   Allow greater flexibility and hierarchy for related packages, such as
    `Database.Client` and `Database.Server`.
-   Would allow using GitHub repository names as package names. For example,
    `carbon-language/carbon-toolchain` could become
    `carbon_language.carbon_toolchain`.

Disadvantages:

-   Multiple identifiers is more complex.
-   Other languages with similar distribution packages don't have a hierarchy,
    and so it may be unnecessary for us.
    -   In other languages that use packages for distribution, they apply
        similar restrictions. For example,
        [Node.JS/NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/), [Python PyPi](https://pypi.org/),
        or [Rust Crates](https://crates.io/).
    -   In [Rust Crates](https://crates.io/), we can observe an example
        `winapi-build` and `winapi-util`.
-   We can build a custom system for reserving package names in Carbon.

At present, we are choosing to use single-identifier package names because of
the lack of clear advantage towards a more complex name path.

#### Referring to the package as `package`

Right now, we plan to refer to the package containing the current file by name.
What's important in the below example is the use of `Math.Stats`:

```carbon
package Math library "Stats" api;
api struct Stats { ... }
struct Quantiles {
  fn Stats();
  fn Build() {
    ...
    var Math.Stats: b;
    ...
  }
}
```

We could instead use `package` as an identifier within the file to refer to the
package, giving `package.Stats`.

It's important to consider how this behaves for `impl` files, which expect an
implicit import of the API. In other words, for `impl` files, this can be
compared to an implicit `import Math;` versus an implicit
`import Math as package;`. However, there may also be _explicit_ imports from
the package, such as `import Math library "Trigonometry";`, which may or may not
be referable to using `package`, depending on the precise option used.

Advantages:

-   Gives a stable name to refer to the current library's package.
    -   This reduces the amount of work necessary if the current library's
        package is renamed, although imports and library consumers may still
        need to be updated. If the library can also refer to the package by the
        package name, even with imports from other libraries within the package,
        work may not be significantly reduced.
-   The same syntax can be used to refer to entities with the same name as the
    package.
    -   For example, in a
        [package named `DateTime`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/datetime.html#datetime-objects),
        `package.DateTime` is unambiguous, whereas `DateTime.DateTime` could be
        confusing.

Disadvantages:

-   We are likely to want a more fine-grained, file-level approach proposed by
    [name lookup](/docs/design/name_lookup.md).
-   Allows package owners to name their packages things that they rarely type,
    but that importers end up typing frequently.
    -   The existence of a short `package` keyword shifts the balance for long
        package names by placing less burden on the package owner.
-   Reuses the `package` keyword with a significantly different meaning,
    changing from a prefix for the required declaration at the top of the file,
    to an identifier within the file.
    -   We don't need to have a special way to refer to the package to
        disambiguate duplicate names. In other words, there is likely to be
        other syntax for referring to an entity `DateTime` in the package
        `DateTime`.
    -   Renaming to a `library` keyword has been suggested to address concerns
        with `package`. Given that `library` is an argument to `package`, it
        does not significantly change the con.
-   Creates inconsistencies as compared to imports from other packages, such as
    `package Math; import Geometry;`, and imports from the current package, such
    as `package Math; import Math library "Stats";`.
    -   Option 1: Require `package` to be used to refer to all imports from
        `Math`, including the current file. This gives consistent treatment for
        the `Math` package, but not for other imports. In other words,
        developers will always write `package.Stats` from within `Math`, and
        `Math.Stats` will only be written in _other_ packages.
    -   Option 2: Require `package` be used for the current library's entities,
        but not other imports. This gives consistent treatment for imports, but
        not for the `Math` package as a whole. In other words, developers will
        only write `package.Stats` when referring to the current library,
        whether in `api` or `impl` files. `Math.Stats` will be used elsewhere,
        including from within the `Math` package.
    -   Option 3: Allow either `package` or the full package name to refer to
        the current package. This allows code to say either `package` or `Math`,
        with no enforcement for consistency. In other words, both
        `package.Stats` and `Math.Stats` are valid within the `Math` package.

Because name lookup can be expected to address the underlying issue differently,
we will not add a feature to support name lookup. We also don't want package
owners to name their packages things that even _they_ find difficult to type. As
part of pushing library authors to consider how their package will be used, we
require them to specify the package by name where desired.

#### Remove the `library` keyword from `package` and `import`

Right now, we have syntax such as:

```carbon
package Math library "Median" api;
package Math library "Median" namespace Stats api;
import Math library "Median";
```

We could remove `library`, resulting in:

```carbon
package Math.Median api;
package Math.Median namespace Math.Stats api;
import Math.Median;
```

Advantages:

-   Reduces redundant syntax in library declarations.
    -   We expect libraries to be common, so this may add up.

Disadvantages:

-   Reduces explicitness of package vs library concepts.
-   Creates redundancy of the package name in the namespace declaration.
    -   Instead of `package Math.Median namespace Math.Stats`, could instead use
        `Stats`, or `this.Stats` to elide the package name.
-   Potentially confuses the library names, such as `Math.Median`, with
    namespace names, such as `Math.Stats`.
-   Either obfuscates or makes it difficult to put multiple libraries in the
    top-level namespace.
    -   This is important because we are interested in encouraging such
        behavior.
    -   For example, if `package Math.Median api;` uses the `Math` namespace,
        the presence of `Median` with the same namespace syntax obfuscates the
        actual namespace.
    -   For example, if `package Math.Median namespace Math api` is necessary to
        use the `Math` namespace, requiring the `namespace` keyword makes it
        difficult to put multiple libraries in the top-level namespace.

As part of avoiding confusion between libraries and namespaces, we are declining
this alternative.

#### Rename package concept

In other languages, a "package" is equivalent to what we call the name path
here, which includes the `namespace`. We may want to rename the `package`
keyword to avoid conflicts in meaning.

Alternative names could be 'bundle', 'universe', or something similar to Rust's
'crates'; perhaps 'compound' or 'molecule'.

Advantages:

-   Avoids conflicts in meaning with other languages.
    -   [Java](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/glossary.html), similar
        to a namespace path.
    -   [Go](https://golang.org/doc/effective_go.html#package-names), similar to
        a namespace path.

Disadvantages:

-   The meaning of `package` also overlaps a fair amount, and we would lose that
    context.
    -   [Package management systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_software_package_management_systems)
        in general.
    -   [NPM/Node.js](https://www.npmjs.com/), as a distributable unit.
    -   [Python](https://packaging.python.org/tutorials/installing-packages/),
        as a distributable unit.
    -   [Rust](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch07-01-packages-and-crates.html),
        as a collection of crates.
    -   [Swift](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift_packages), as a
        distributable unit.

#### No association between the file system path and library/namespace

Several languages create a strict association between the method for pulling in
an API and the path to the file that provides it. For example:

-   In C++, `#include` refers to specific files without any abstraction.
    -   For example, `#include "PATH/TO/FILE.h"` means there's a file
        `PATH/TO/FILE.h`.
-   In Java, `package` and `import` both reflect file system structure.
    -   For example, `import PATH.TO.FILE;` means there's a file
        `PATH/TO/FILE.java`.
-   In Python, `import` requires matching file system structure.
    -   For example, `import PATH.TO.FILE` means there's a file
        `PATH/TO/FILE.py`.
-   In TypeScript, `import` refers to specific files.
    -   For example, `import {...} from 'PATH/TO/FILE';` means there's a file
        `PATH/TO/FILE.ts`.

For contrast:

-   In Go, `package` uses an arbitrary name.
    -   For example, `import "PATH/TO/NAME"` means there is a directory
        `PATH/TO` that contains one or more files starting with `package NAME`.

In Carbon, we are using a strict association to say that
`import PACKAGE library "PATH/TO/LIBRARY"` means there is a file
`PATH/TO/LIBRARY.carbon` under some package root.

Advantages:

-   The strict association makes it harder to move names between files without
    updating callers.
-   If there were a strict association of paths, it would also need to handle
    file system-dependent casing behaviors.
    -   For example, on Windows, `project.carbon` and `Project.carbon` are
        conflicting filenames. This is exacerbated by paths, wherein a file
        `config` and a directory `Config/` would conflict, even though this
        would be a valid structure on Unix-based filesystems.

Disadvantages:

-   A strict association between file system path and import path makes it
    easier to find source files. This is used by some languages for compilation.
-   Allows getting rid of the `package` keyword by inferring related information
    from the file system path.

We are choosing to have some association between the file system path and
library for API files to make it easier to find a library's files. We are not
getting rid of the `package` keyword because we don't want to become dependent
on file system structures, particularly as it would increase the complexity of
distributed builds.

### Libraries

#### Allow exporting namespaces

We propose to not allow exporting namespaces as part of library APIs. We could
either allow or require exporting namespaces. For example:

```carbon
package Checksums;

api namespace Sha256;
```

While this approach would mainly be syntactic, a more pragmatic use of this
would be in refactoring. It implies that an aliased namespace could be marked as
an `api`. For example, the below could be used to share an import's full
contents:

```carbon
package Translator library "Interface" api;

import Translator library "Functions" as TranslatorFunctions;

api alias Functions = TranslatorFunctions;
```

Advantages:

-   Avoids any inconsistency in how entities are handled.
-   Reinforces whether a namespace may contain `api` entities.
-   Enables new kinds of refactorings.

Disadvantages:

-   Creates extra syntax for users to remember, and possibly forget, when
    declaring `api` entities.
    -   Makes it possible to have a namespace marked as `api` that doesn't
        contain any `api` entities.
-   Allowing aliasing of entire imports makes it ambiguous which entities are
    being passed on through the namespace.
    -   This may impair refactoring.
    -   This can be considered related to
        [broader imports, either all names or arbitrary code](#broader-imports-either-all-names-or-arbitrary-code).

This alternative is declined because it's not sufficiently clear it'll be
helpful, versus impairment of refactoring.

#### Allow importing implementation files from within the same library

The current proposal is that implementation files in a library implicitly import
their API, and that they cannot import other implementation files in the same
library.

We could instead allow importing implementation files from within the same
library. There are two ways this could be done:

-   We could add a syntax for importing symbols from other files in the same
    library. This would make it easy to identify a directed acyclic graph
    between files in the library. For example:

    ```carbon
    package Geometry;

    import file("point.6c");
    ```

-   We could automatically detect when symbols from elsewhere in the library are
    referenced, given an import of the same library. For example:

    ```carbon
    package Geometry;

    import this;
    ```

Advantages:

-   Allows more separation of implementation between files within a library.

Disadvantages:

-   Neither approach is quite clean:
    -   Using filenames creates a common case where filenames _must_ be used,
        breaking away from name paths.
    -   Detecting where symbols exist may cause separate parsing, compilation
        debugging, and compilation parallelism problems.
-   Libraries are supposed to be small, and we've chosen to only allow one API
    file per library to promote that concept. Encouraging implementation files
    to be inter-dependent appears to support a more complex library design
    again, and may be better addressed through inter-library ACLs.
-   Loses some of the ease-of-use that some other languages have around imports,
    such as Go.
-   Part of the argument towards `api` and `impl`, particularly with a single
    `api`, has been to mirror C++ `.h` and `.cc`. Wherein a `.cc` `#include`-ing
    other `.cc` files is undesirable, allowing a `impl` to import another `impl`
    could be considered similarly.

The problems with these approaches, and encouragement towards small libraries,
is how we reach the current approach of only importing APIs, and automatically.

#### Alternative library separators and shorthand

Examples are using `/` to separator significant terms in library names, and `//`
to separate the package name in shorthand. For example,
`package Time library "Timezones/Internal";` with shorthand
`Time//Timezones/Internal`.

Note that, because the library is an arbitrary string and shorthand is not a
language semantic, this won't affect much. However, users should be expected to
treat examples as best practice.

We could instead use `.` for library names and `/` for packages, such as
`Time/Timezones.Internal`.

Advantages:

-   Clearer distinction between the package and library, increasing readability.
-   We have chosen not to [enforce file system
    paths](#strict-association-between-the-file
    system-path-and-librarynamespace) in order to ease refactoring, and
    encouraging a mental model where they may match could confuse users.

Disadvantages:

-   Uses multiple separators, so people need to type different characters.
-   There is a preference for thinking of libraries like file system paths, even
    if they don't actually correspond.

People like `/`, so we're going with `/`.

##### Single-word libraries

We could stick to single word libraries in examples, such as replacing
`library "Algorithms/Distance"` with `library "Distance"`.

Advantages:

-   Encourages short library names.

Disadvantages:

-   Users are likely to end up doing some hierarchy, and we should address it.
    -   Consistency will improve code understandability.

We might list this as a best practice, and have Carbon only expose libraries
following it. However, some hierarchy from users can be expected, and so it's
worthwhile to include a couple examples to nudge users towards consistency.

#### Collapse API and implementation file concepts

We could remove the distinction between API and implementation files.

Advantages:

-   Removing the distinction between API and implementation would be a language
    simplification.
-   Developers will not need to consider build performance impacts of how they
    are distributing code between files.

Disadvantages:

-   Serializes compilation across dependencies.
    -   May be exacerbated because developers won't be aware of when they are
        adding a dependency that affects imports.
    -   In large codebases, it's been necessary to abstract out API from
        implementation in languages that similarly consolidate files, such as
        Java. However, the lack of language-level support constrains potential
        benefit and increases friction for a split.
-   Whereas an `api`/`impl` hierarchy gives a structure for compilation, if
    there are multiple files we will likely need to provide a different
    structure, perhaps explicit file imports, to indicate intra-library
    compilation dependencies.
    -   We could also effectively concatenate and compile a library together,
        reducing build parallelism options differently.
-   Makes it harder for users to determine what the API is, as they must read
    all the files.

Requiring users to manage the `api`/`impl` split allows us to speed up
compilation for large codebases. This is important for large codebases, and
shouldn't directly affect small codebases that choose to only use `api` files.

##### Automatically generating the API separation

We could try to address the problems with collapsing API and implementation
files by automatically generating an API file from the input files for a
library.

For example, it may preprocess files to split out an API, reducing the number of
imports propagated for _actual_ APIs. For example:

1. Extract `api` declarations within the `api` file.
2. Remove all implementation bodies.
3. Add only the imports that are referenced.

Even under the proposed model, compilation will do some of this work as an
optimization. However, determining which imports are referenced requires
compilation of all imports that _may_ be referenced. When multiple libraries are
imported from a single package, it will be ambiguous which imports are used
until all have been compiled. This will cause serialization of compilation that
can be avoided by having a developer split out the `impl`, either manually or
with developer tooling.

The `impl` files may make it easier to read code, but they will also allow for
better parallelism than `api` files alone can. This does not mean the compiler
will or will not add optimizations -- it only means that we cannot wholly rely
on optimizations by the compiler.

Automatically generating the API separation would only partly mitigate the
serialization of compilation caused by collapsing file and library concepts.
Most of the build performance impact would still be felt by large codebases, and
so the mitigation does not significantly improve
[the alternative](#collapse-api-and-implementation-file-concepts).

#### Collapse file and library concepts

We could collapse the file and library concepts. What this implies is:

-   [Collapse API and implementation file concepts](#collapse-api-and-implementation-file-concepts).
    -   As described there, this approach significantly reduces the ability to
        separate compilation.
-   Only support having one file per library.
    -   The file would need to contain both API and implementation together.

This has similar advantages and disadvantages to
[collapse API and implementation file concepts](#collapse-api-and-implementation-file-concepts).
Differences follow.

Advantages:

-   Offers a uniformity of language usage.
    -   Otherwise, some developers will use only `api` files, while others will
        always use `impl` files.
-   The structure of putting API and implementation in a single file mimics
    other modern languages, such as Java.
-   Simplifies IDEs and refactoring tools.
    -   Otherwise, these systems will need to understand the potential for
        separation of interface from implementation between multiple files.
    -   For example, see
        [potential refactorings](/docs/design/code_and_name_organization/README.md#potential-refactorings).

Disadvantages:

-   Avoids the need to establish a hierarchy between files in a library, at the
    cost of reducing build parallelism options further.
-   While both API and implementation is in the same file, it can be difficult
    to visually identify the API when it's mixed with a lengthy implementation.

As with
[collapse API and implementation file concepts](#collapse-api-and-implementation-file-concepts),
we consider the split to be important for large codebases. The additional
advantages of a single-file restriction do not outweigh the disadvantages
surrounding build performance.

#### Collapse the library concept into packages

We could only have packages, with no libraries. Some other languages do this;
for example, in Node.JS, a package is often similar in size to what we currently
call a library.

If packages became larger, that would lead to compile-time bottlenecks. Thus, if
Carbon allowed large packages without library separation, we would undermine our
goals for fast compilation. Even if we combined the concepts, we should expect
it's by turning the "package with many small libraries" concept into "many small
packages".

Advantages:

-   Simplification of organizational hierarchy.
    -   Less complexity for users to think about on imports.

Disadvantages:

-   Coming up with short, unique package names may become an issue, leading to
    longer package names that overlap with the intent of libraries.
    -   These longer package names would need to be used to refer to contained
        entities in code, affecting brevity of Carbon code. The alternative
        would be to expect users to always rename packages on import; some
        organizations anecdotally see equivalent happen for C++ once names get
        longer than six characters.
    -   For example, [boost](https://github.com/boostorg) could use
        per-repository packages like `BoostGeometry` and child libraries like
        `algorithms-distance` under the proposed approach. Under the alternative
        approach, it would use either a monolithic package that could create
        compile-time bottlenecks, or packages like
        `BoostGeometryAlgorithmsDistance` for uniqueness.
-   While a package manager will need a way to specify cross-package version
    compatibility, encouraging a high number of packages puts more weight and
    maintenance cost on the configuration.
    -   We expect libraries to be versioned at the package-level.

We prefer to keep the library separation to enable better hierarchy for large
codebases, plus encouraging small units of compilation. It's still possible for
people to create small Carbon packages, without breaking it into multiple
libraries.

#### Collapse the package concept into libraries

Versus
[collapse the library concept into packages](#collapse-the-library-concept-into-packages),
we could have libraries without packages. Under this model, we still have
libraries of similar granularity as what's proposed. However, there is no
package grouping to them: there are only libraries which happen to share a
namespace.

References to imports from other top-level namespaces would need to be prefixed
with a '`.`' in order to make it clear which symbols were from imports.

For example, suppose `Boost` is a large system that cannot be distributed to
users in a single package. As a result, `Random` functionality is in its own
distribution package, with multiple libraries contained. The difference between
approaches looks like:

-   `package` vs `library`:
    -   Trivial:
        -   Proposal: `package BoostRandom;`
        -   Alternative: `library "Boost/Random" namespace Boost;`
    -   Multi-layer library:
        -   Proposal: `package BoostRandom library "Uniform";`
        -   Alternative: `library "Boost/Random.Uniform" namespace Boost;`
    -   Specifying namespaces:
        -   Proposal: `package BoostRandom namespace Distributions;`
        -   Alternative:
            `library "Boost/Random.Uniform" namespace Boost.Random.Distributions;`
    -   Combined:
        -   Proposal:
            `package BoostRandom library "Uniform" namespace Distributions;`
        -   Alternative:
            `library "Boost/Random.Uniform" namespace Boost.Random.Distributions;`
-   `import` changes:
    -   Trivial:
        -   Proposal: `import BoostRandom;`
        -   Alternative: `import "Boost/Random";`
    -   Multi-layer library:
        -   Proposal: `import BoostRandom library "Uniform";`
        -   Alternative: `import "Boost/Random.Uniform";`
    -   Namespaces have no effect on `import` under both approaches.
-   Changes to use an imported entity:
    -   Proposal: `BoostRandom.UniformDistribution`
    -   Alternative:
        -   If the code is in the `Boost.Random` namespace: `Uniform`
        -   If the code is in the `Boost` package but a different namespace:
            `Random.Uniform`
        -   If the code is outside the `Boost` package: `.Boost.Random.Uniform`

We assume that the compiler will enforce that the root namespace must either
match or be a prefix of the library name, followed by a `/` separator. For
example, `Boost` in the namespace `Boost.Random.Uniform` must either match a
`library "Boost"` or prefix as `library "Boost/..."`; `library "BoostRandom"`
does not match because it's missing the `/` separator.

There are several approaches which might remove this duplication, but each has
been declined due to flaws:

-   We could have `library "Boost/Random.Uniform";` imply `namespace Boost`.
    However, we want name paths to use things listed as identifiers in files. We
    specifically do not want to use strings to generate identifiers in order to
    support understandability of code.
-   We could alternately have `namespace Boost;` syntax imply
    `library "Boost" namespace Boost;`.
    -   This approach only helps with single-library namespaces. While this
        would be common enough that a special syntax would help some developers,
        we are likely to encourage multiple libraries per namespace as part of
        best practices. We would then expect that the quantity of libraries in
        multi-library namespaces would dominate cost-benefit, leaving this to
        address only an edge-case of duplication issues.
    -   This would create an ambiguity between the file-level `namespace` and
        other `namespace` keyword use. We could then rename the `namespace`
        argument for `library` to something like `file-namespace`.
    -   It may be confusing as to what `namespace Boost.Random;` does. It may
        create `library "Boost/Random"` because `library "Boost.Random"` would
        not be legal, but the change in characters may in turn lead to developer
        confusion.
        -   We could change the library specification to use `.` instead of `/`
            as a separator, but that may lead to broader confusion about the
            difference between libraries and namespaces.

Advantages:

-   Avoids introducing the "package" concept to code and name organization.
    -   Retains the key property that library and namespace names have a prefix
        that is intended to be globally unique.
    -   Avoids coupling package management to namespace structure. For example,
        it would permit a library collection like Boost to be split into
        multiple repositories and multiple distribution packages, while
        retaining a single top-level namespace.
-   The library and namespace are pushed to be more orthogonal concepts than
    packages and namespaces.
    -   Although some commonality must still be compiler-enforced.
-   For the common case where packages have multiple libraries, removing the
    need to specify both a package and library collapses two keywords into one
    for both `import` and `package`.
-   It makes it easier to draw on C++ intuitions, because all the concepts have
    strong counterparts in C++.
-   The prefix `.` on imported name paths can help increase readability by
    making it clear they're from imports, so long as those imports aren't from
    the current top-level namespace.
-   Making the `.` optional for imports from the current top-level namespace
    eliminates the boilerplate character when calling within the same library.

Disadvantages:

-   The use of a leading `.` to mark absolute paths may conflict with other
    important uses, such as designated initializers and named parameters.
-   Declines an opportunity to align code and name organization with package
    distribution.
    -   Alignment means that if a developer sees
        `package BoostRandom library "Uniform";`, they know installing a package
        `BoostRandom` will give them the library. Declining this means that
        users seeing `library "Boost/Random.Uniform"`, they will still need to
        do research as to what package contains `Boost/Random.Uniform` to figure
        out how to install it because that package may not be named `Boost`.
    -   Package distribution is a
        [project goal](/docs/project/goals.md#language-tools-and-ecosystem), and
        cannot be avoided indefinitely.
    -   This also means multiple packages may contribute to the same top-level
        namespace, which would prevent things like tab-completion in IDEs from
        producing cache optimizations based on the knowledge that modified
        packages cannot add to a given top-level namespace. For example, the
        ability to load less may improve performance:
        -   As proposed, a package `BoostRandom` only adds to a namespace of the
            same name. If a user is editing libraries in a package
            `BoostCustom`, then `BoostRandom` may be treated as unmodifiable. An
            IDE could optimize cache invalidation of `BoostRandom` at the
            package level. As a result, if a user types `BoostRandom.` and
            requests a tab completion, the system need only ensure that
            libraries from the `BoostRandom.` package are loaded for an accurate
            result.
        -   Under this alternative, a library `Boost.Random` similarly adds to
            the namespace `Boost`. However, if a user is editing libraries, the
            IDE needs to support them adding to both `Boost` and `MyProject`
            simultaneously. As a result, if a user types `Boost.` and requests a
            tab completion, the system must have all libraries from all packages
            loaded for an accurate result.
        -   Although many features can restricted to _current_ imports, some
            features, such as
            [auto-imports](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/creating-and-optimizing-imports.html),
            examine _possible_ imports. Large codebases may have a
            memory-constrained quantity of possible imports.
-   The string prefix enforcement between `library` and `namespace` forces
    duplication between both, which would otherwise be handled by `package`.
-   For the common case of packages with a matching namespace name, increases
    verbosity by requiring the `namespace` keyword.
-   The prefix `.` on imported name paths will be repeated frequently through
    code, increasing overall verbosity, versus the package approach which only
    affects import verbosity.
-   Making the `.` optional for imports from the current top-level namespace
    hides whether an API comes from the current library or an import.

We are declining this approach because we desire package separation, and because
of concerns that this will lead to an overall increase in verbosity due to the
[preference for few child namespaces](/docs/design/code_and_name_organization/README.md#preference-for-few-child-namespaces),
whereas this alternative benefits when `namespace` is specified more often.

#### Different file type labels

We're using `api` and `impl` for file types, and have `test` as an open
question.

We've considered using `interface` instead of `api`, but that introduces a
terminology collision with interfaces in the type system.

We've considered dropping `api` from naming, but that creates a definition from
absence of a keyword. It also would be more unusual if both `impl` and `test`
must be required, that `api` would be excluded. We prefer the more explicit
name.

We could spell out `impl` as `implementation`, but are choosing the abbreviation
for ease of typing. We also don't think it's an unclear abbreviation.

We expect `impl` to be used for implementations of `interface`. This isn't quite
as bad as if we used `interface` instead of `api` because of the `api` export
syntax on entities, such as `api fn DoSomething()`, which could create
ambiguities as `interface fn DoSomething()`. It may still confuse people to see
an `interface impl` in an `api` file. However, we're touching on related
concepts and don't see a great alternative.

#### Function-like syntax

We could consider more function-like syntax for `import`, and possibly also
`package`.

For example, instead of:

```carbon
import Math library "Stats";
import Algebra as A;
```

We could do:

```carbon
import("Math", "Stats").Math;
alias A = import("Algebra").Algebra;
```

Or some related variation.

Advantages:

-   Allows straightforward reuse of `alias` for language consistency.
-   Easier to add more optional arguments, which we expect to need for
    [interoperability](/docs/design/code_and_name_organization/README.md#imports-from-other-languages)
    and
    [URLs](/docs/design/code_and_name_organization/README.md#imports-from-urls).
-   Avoids defining keywords for optional fields, such as `library`.
    -   Interoperability and package management may add more fields long-term.

Disadvantages:

-   It's unusual for a function-like syntax to produce identifiers for name
    lookup.
    -   This could be addressed by _requiring_ alias, but that becomes verbose.
    -   There's a desire to explicitly note the identifier being imported some
        way, as with `.Math` and `.Algebra` above. However, this complicates the
        resulting syntax.

The preference is for keywords.

#### Inlining from implementation files

An implicit reason for keeping code in an `api` file is that it makes it
straightforward to inline code from there into callers.

We could explicitly encourage inlining from `impl` files as well, making the
location of code unimportant during compilation. Alternately, we could add an
`inline` file type which explicitly supports separation of inline code from the
`api` file.

Advantages:

-   Allows moving code out of the main API file for easier reading.

Disadvantages:

-   Requires compilation of `impl` files to determine what can be inlined from
    the `api` file, leading to the transitive closure dependency problems which
    `impl` files are intended to avoid.

We expect to only support inlining from `api` files in order to avoid confusion
about dependency problems.

#### Library-private access controls

We currently have no special syntax for library-private APIs. However,
non-exported APIs are essentially library-private, and may be in the `api` file.
It's been suggested that we could either provide a special syntax or a new file
type, such as `shared_impl`, to support library-private APIs.

Advantages:

-   Allows for better separation of library-private APIs.

Disadvantages:

-   Increases language complexity.
-   Dependencies are still an issue for library-private APIs.
    -   If used from the `api` file, the dependencies are still in the
        transitive closure of client libraries, and any separation may confuse
        users about the downsides of the extra dependencies.
    -   If only used from `impl` files, then they could be in the `impl` file if
        there's only one, or shared from a separate library.
-   Generalized access controls may provide overlapping functionality.

At this point in time, we prefer not to provide specialized access controls for
library-private APIs.

#### Managing API versus implementation in libraries

At present, we plan to have `api` versus `impl` as a file type, and also
`.carbon` versus `.impl.carbon` as the file extension. We chose to use both
together, rather than one or the other, because we expect some parties to
strongly want file content to be sufficient for compilation, while others will
want file extensions to be meaningful for the syntax split.

Instead of the file type split, we could drift further and instead have APIs in
any file in a library, using the same kind of
[API markup](/docs/design/code_and_name_organization/README.md#exporting-entities-from-an-api-file).

Advantages:

-   May help users who have issues with cyclical code references.
-   Improves compiler inlining of implementations, because the compiler can
    decide how much to actually put in the generated API.

Disadvantages:

-   While allowing users to spread a library across multiple files can be
    considered an advantage, we see the single API file as a way to pressure
    users towards smaller libraries, which we prefer.
-   May be slower to compile because each file must be parsed once to determine
    APIs.
-   For users that want to see _only_ APIs in a file, they would need to use
    tooling to generate the API file.
    -   Auto-generated documentation may help solve this problem.

#### Multiple API files

The proposal also presently suggests a single API file. Under an explicit API
file approach, we could still allow multiple API files.

Advantages:

-   More flexibility when writing APIs; could otherwise end up with one gigantic
    API file.

Disadvantages:

-   Encourages larger libraries by making it easier to provide large APIs.
-   Removes some of the advantages of having an API file as a "single place" to
    look, suggesting more towards the markup approach.
-   Not clear if API files should be allowed to depend on each other, as they
    were intended to help resolve cyclical dependency issues.

We particularly want to discourage large libraries, and so we're likely to
retain the single API file limit.

#### Name paths as library names

We're proposing strings for library names. We've discussed also using name paths
(`My.Library`) and also restricting to single identifiers (`Library`).

Advantages:

-   Shares the form between packages (identifiers) and namespaces (name paths).
-   Enforces a constrained set of names for libraries for cross-package
    consistency of naming.

Disadvantages:

-   Indicates that a library may be referred to in code, when only the package
    and namespace are used for name paths of entities.
-   The constrained set of names may also get in the way for some packages that
    can make use of more flexibility in naming.

We've decided to use strings primarily because we want to draw the distinction
that a library is not something that's used when referring to an entity in code.

### Imports

#### Block imports

Rather than requiring an `import` keyword per line, we could support block
imports, as can be found in languages like Go.

In other words, instead of:

```carbon
import Math;
import Geometry;
```

We could have:

```carbon
imports {
  Math,
  Geometry,
}
```

Advantages:

-   Allows repeated imports with less typing.

Disadvantages:

-   Makes it harder to find files importing a package or library using tools
    like `grep`.

One concern has been that a mix of `import` and `imports` syntax would be
confusing to users: we should only allow one.

This alternative has been declined because retyping `import` statements is
low-cost, and `grep` is useful.

#### Block imports of libraries of a single package

We could allow block imports of libraries from the same package. For example:

```carbon
import Containers libraries({
  "FlatHashMap",
  "FlatHashSet",
})
```

The result of this `api alias` allowing `Containers.HashSet()` to work
regardless of whether `HashSet` is in `"HashContainers"` or `"Internal"` may be
clearer if both `import Containers` statements were a combined
`import Containers libraries({"HashContainers", "Internal"});`.

The advantages/disadvantages are similar to [block imports](#block-imports).
Additional advantages/disadvantages are:

Advantages:

-   If we limit to one import per library, then any `alias` of the package
    `Containers` is easier to understand as affecting all libraries.

Disadvantages:

-   If we allow both `library` and `libraries` syntax, it's two was of doing the
    same thing.
    -   Can be addressed by _always_ requiring `libraries`, removing `library`,
        but that diverges from `package`'s `library` syntax.

This alternative has been declined for similar reasons to block imports; the
additional advantages/disadvantages don't substantially shift the cost-benefit
argument.

#### Broader imports, either all names or arbitrary code

Carbon imports require specifying individual names to import. We could support
broader imports, for example by pulling in all names from a library. In C++, the
`#include` preprocessor directive even supports inclusion of arbitrary code. For
example:

```carbon
import Geometry library "Shapes" names *;

// Triangle was imported as part of "*".
fn Draw(var Triangle: x) { ... }
```

Advantages:

-   Reduces boilerplate code specifying individual names.

Disadvantages:

-   Loses out on parser benefits of knowing which identifiers are being
    imported.
-   Increases the risk of adding new features to APIs, as they may immediately
    get imported by a user and conflict with a preexisting name, breaking code.
-   As the number of imports increases, it can become difficult to tell which
    import a particular symbol comes from, or how imports are being used.
-   Arbitrary code inclusion can result in unexpected code execution, a way to
    create obfuscated code and a potential security risk.

We particularly value the parser benefits of knowing which identifiers are being
imported, and so we require individual names for imports.

#### Direct name imports

We could allow direct imports of names from libraries. For example, under the
current setup we might see:

```carbon
import Math library "Stats";
alias Median = Stats.Median;
alias Mean = Stats.Mean;
```

We could simplify this syntax by augmenting `import`:

```carbon
import Math library "Stats" name Median;
import Math library "Stats" name Mean;
```

Or more succinctly with block imports of names:

```carbon
import Math library "Stats" names {
  Median,
  Mean,
}
```

Advantages:

-   Avoids an additional `alias` step.

Disadvantages:

-   With a single name, this isn't a significant improvement in syntax.
-   With multiple names, this runs into similar issues as
    [block imports](#block-imports).

#### Optional package names

We could allow a short syntax for imports from the current library. For example,
this code imports `Geometry.Shapes`:

```carbon
package Geometry library "Operations" api;

import library "Shapes";
```

Advantages:

-   Reduces typing.

Disadvantages:

-   Makes it harder to find files importing a package or library using tools
    like `grep`.
-   Creates two syntaxes for importing libraries from the current package.
    -   If we instead disallow `import Geometry library "Shapes"` from within
        `Geometry`, then we end up with a different inconsistency.

Overall, consistent with the decision to disallow
[block imports](#block-imports), we are choosing to require the package name.

### Namespaces

#### File-level namespaces

We are providing entity-level namespaces. This is likely necessary to support
migrating C++ code, at a minimum. It's been discussed whether we should _also_
support file-level namespaces.

For example, this is the current syntax for defining `Geometry.Shapes.Circle`:

```carbon
package Geometry library "Shapes" api;

namespace Shapes;
struct Shapes.Circle;
```

This is the proposed alternative syntax for defining `Geometry.Shapes.Circle`,
and would put all entities in the file under the `Shapes` namespace:

```carbon
package Geometry library "Shapes" namespace Shapes api;

struct Circle;
```

Advantages:

-   Reduces repetitive syntax in the file when every entity should be in the
    same, child namespace.
    -   Large libraries and packages are more likely to be self-referential, and
        may pay a disproportionate ergonomics tax that others wouldn't see.
    -   Although library authors could also avoid this repetitive syntax by
        omitting the namespace, that may in turn lead to more name collisions
        for large packages.
    -   Note that syntax can already be reduced with a shorter namespace alias,
        but the redundancy cannot be _eliminated_.
-   Reduces the temptation of aliasing in order to reduce verbosity, wherein
    it's generally agreed that aliasing creates inconsistent names which hinder
    readability.
    -   Users are known to alias long names, where "long" may be considered
        anything over six characters.
    -   This is a risk for any package that uses namespaces, as importers may
        also need to address it.

Disadvantages:

-   Encourages longer namespace names, as they won't need to be retyped.
-   Increases complexity of the `package` keyword.
-   Creates two ways of defining namespaces, and reuses the `namespace` keyword
    in multiple different ways.
    -   We generally prefer to provide one canonical way of doing things.
    -   Does not add functionality which cannot be achieved with entity-level
        namespaces. However, the converse is not true: entity-level control
        allows a single file to put entities into multiple namespaces.
-   Creates a divergence between code as written by the library maintainer and
    code as called.
    -   Calling code would need to specify the namespace, even if aliased to a
        shorter name. Library code gets to omit this, essentially getting a free
        alias.

We are choosing not to provide this for now because we want to provide the
minimum necessary support, and then see if it works out. It may be added later,
but it's easier to add features than to remove them.

#### Scoped namespaces

Instead of including additional namespace information per-name, we could have
scoped namespaces, similar to C++. For example:

```carbon
namespace absl {
  namespace numbers_internal {
    fn SafeStrto32Base(...) { ... }
  }

  fn SimpleAtoi(...) {
    ...
    return numbers_internal.SafeStrto32Base(...);
    ...
  }
}
```

Advantages:

-   Makes it easy to write many things in the same namespace.

Disadvantages:

-   It's not clear which namespace an identifier is in without scanning to the
    start of the file.
-   It can be hard to find the end of a namespace. For examples addressing this,
    end-of-namespace comments are called for by both the
    [Google](https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html#Namespaces) and
    [Boost](https://github.com/boostorg/geometry/wiki/Guidelines-for-Developers)
    style guides.
    -   Carbon may disallow the same-line-as-code comment style used for this.
        Even if not, if we acknowledge it's a problem, we should address it
        structurally for
        [readability](/docs/project/goals.md#code-that-is-easy-to-read-understand-and-write).
    -   This is less of a problem for other scopes, such as functions, because
        they can often be broken apart until they fit on a single screen.

There are other ways to address the con, such as adding syntax to indicate the
end of a namespace, similar to block comments. For example:

```carbon
{ namespace absl
  { namespace numbers_internal
    fn SafeStrto32Base(...) { ... }
  } namespace numbers_internal

  fn SimpleAtoi(...) {
    ...
    return numbers_internal.SafeStrto32Base(...);
    ...
  }
} namespace absl
```

While we could consider such alternative approaches, we believe the proposed
contextless namespace approach is better, as it reduces information that
developers will need to remember when reading/writing code.

## Rationale

This proposal provides an organizational structure that seems both workable and
aligns well with Carbon's goals:

-   Distinct and required top-level namespace -- "package"s from the proposal --
    both matches software best practices for long-term evolution, and avoids
    complex and user-confusing corner cases.
-   Providing a fine-grained import structure as provided by the "library"
    concept supports scalable build system implementations while ensuring
    explicit dependencies.
-   The structured namespace facilities provide a clear mechanism to migrate
    existing hierarchical naming structures in C++ code.

### Open questions

#### Should we switch to a library-oriented structure that's package-agnostic?

-   **Decision:** No.
-   **Rationale:** While this would simplify the overall set of constructs
    needed, removing the concept of a global namespace remained desirable and
    would require re-introducing much of the complexity around top-level
    namespaces. Overall, the simplification trade-off didn't seem significantly
    better.

#### Should there be a tight association between file paths and packages/libraries?

-   **Decision:** Yes, for the API files in libraries. Specifically, the library
    name should still be written in the source, but it should be checked to
    match -- after some platform-specific translation -- against the path.
-   **Note:** Sufficient restrictions to result in a portable and simple
    translation on different filesystems should be imposed, but the Core team
    was happy for these restrictions to be developed as part of implementation
    work.
-   **Rationale:** This will improve usability and readability for users by
    making it obvious how to find the files that are being imported. Similarly,
    this will improve tooling by increasing the ease with which tools can find
    imported APIs.
