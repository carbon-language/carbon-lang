## Problem

How do developers store code for the compiler, and access it for reuse?

## Proposal

Adopt an approach with tiered files, libraries, packages and namespaces in the
design.

### Out-of-scope issues

Related issues that are out-of-scope for this proposal are:

-   Access control: while there is some implicit access control from interface
    vs implementation considerations for libraries, they are more about
    addressing circular dependencies in code.

-   Aliasing implementation: while the `alias` keyword is critical to how easy
    or difficult refactoring is, it should be designed on its own.

-   Compilation details: this proposal sets up a framework that should enable
    well-designed compilation, but does not set about to design how compilation
    will work.

-   Entity names duplicating package names: Whether `DateTime.DateTime` is
    allowed is not being addressed here. Name lookup is likely to address this
    better, including offering syntax that could refer to it if needed.

-   File-private identifiers: Something similar to C++ `static` functions may
    exist. However, that will be addressed separately.

-   Package management: while we want to choose syntax that won't impose
    barriers on building package management into Carbon, we should not make
    assumptions about how package management should work.

-   Prelude package, or fundamentals: while we've discussed how to handle name
    lookup for things like `Int32`, this proposal mainly lays out a framework
    where options for addressing that are possible.

This proposal should not be interpreted as addressing these issues. A separate
discussion of these issues will remain necessary.

## Open questions for the decision

### Should we remove one of the `namespace` keywords?

Right now, the `namespace` keyword can be used in two places:

-   On the `package` keyword
    ([alternative to remove](/docs/design/code_and_name_organization.md#remove-the-namespace-keyword-from-package-and-import))
-   On its own
    ([alternative to remove](/docs/design/code_and_name_organization.md#coarser-namespace-granularity))

Is the core team okay with two ways to specify namespaces, given the associated
trade-offs?

### Should we use the package name or the `package` keyword to refer to the current package?

Given the code sample:

```carbon
package Math library("Stats") api;
api struct Stats { ... }
struct Quantiles {
  fn Stats();
  fn Build() {
    ...
    var SYNTAX.Stats: b;
    ...
  }
}
```

Is the `SYNTAX`:

-   `Math`, as in `Math.Stats`?
-   `package`, as in `package.Stats`?
-   Some other solution?

This is detailed in the
[referring to the package as `package`](/docs/design/code_and_name_organization.md#referring-to-the-package-as-package)
alternative.

## Justification

-   [Software and language evolution](/docs/project/goals.md#software-and-language-evolution):

    -   The syntax and interactions between `package` and `import` should enable
        moving code between files and libraries with fewer modifications to
        callers, easing maintainenance of large codebases.

        -   In C++ terms, `#include` updates are avoidable.

-   [Code that is easy to read, understand, and write](/docs/project/goals.md#code-that-is-easy-to-read-understand-and-write):

    -   By setting up imports so that each name in a file is unique, we make the
        meaning of symbols clear and easier to understand.

    -   The proposed `namespace` syntax additionally makes it clear when the
        file's default namespace is not being used, particularly as an
        improvement over C++'s `namespace` syntax.

    -   Clearly marking interfaces will make it easier for both client code and
        IDE tab completion to more easily determine which APIs can be used from
        a given library.

-   [Fast and scalable development](/docs/projects/goals.md#fast-and-scalable-development):

    -   The structure of libraries and imports should help enable separate
        compilation.

-   [Interoperability with and migration from existing C++ code](/docs/project/goals.md#interoperability-with-and-migration-from-existing-c-code):

    -   The syntax of `import` should enable extending imports for use in
        interop code.
