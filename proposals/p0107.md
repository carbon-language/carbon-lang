## Problem

How do developers store code for the compiler, and access it for reuse?

## Proposal

Adopt an approach with tiered files, libraries, packages and namespaces in the
design.

### Out-of-scope issues

Related issues that are out-of-scope for this proposal are:

-   Access control: while there is some implicit access control from interface
    vs implementation considerations for libraries, they are more about
    addressing circular dependencies in code.

-   Package management: while we want to choose syntax that won't impose
    barriers on building package management into Carbon, we should not make
    assumptions about how package management should work.

-   Prelude package, or fundamentals: while we've discussed how to handle name
    lookup for things like `Int32`, this proposal mainly lays out a framework
    where options for addressing that are possible.

This proposal should not be interpreted as addressing these issues. A separate
discussion of these issues will remain necessary.

## Justification

This proposal touches the most on "Fast and scalable development". Using files
as a basic unit of Carbon compilation in particular is intended to enable
separate compilation, which is a specific goal of Carbon.
