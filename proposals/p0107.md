## Problem

How do developers store code for the compiler, and access it for reuse?

## Proposal

Adopt an approach with tiered files, libraries, packages and namespaces in the
design.

## Justification

This proposal touches the most on "Fast and scalable development". Using files
as a basic unit of Carbon compilation in particular is intended to enable
separate compilation, which is a specific goal of Carbon.
