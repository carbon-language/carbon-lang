## Rationale

-   Easy to follow single source of truth will help foster an open and inclusive
    community.
-   Review requirements and focus on small, incremental changes match well
    established engineering practices for ensuring the project and codebase
    scale up both in size and time dimensions.
-   Linear history seems easier for humans to reason about.
