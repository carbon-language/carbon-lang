## Rationale

- Easy to follow single source of truth will help foster an open and inclusive
  community.
- Review requirements and focus on small, incremental changes match well
  established engineering practices for ensuring the project and codebase scale
  up both in size and time dimensions.
- Linear history seems easier for humans to reason about.
