## Problem

We need to be able to compare values for equality, and to compare ordered values
for relative ordering.

## Background

### Terminology

We refer to tests that check whether two values are the same or different as
_equality_ comparisons, and to tests that determine the relative ordering of two
values as _relational_ comparisons.

### Usage in existing languages

There is near-universal convention on the use of the following symbols for
relational operators:

-   `<`, `<=`, `>`, and `>=` perform ordered comparisons (less than, less than
    or equal to, greater than, greater than or equal to).

There are rare exceptions in somewhat esoteric languages: some languages use `≤`
and `≥`, but these are not straightforward to type for many potential Carbon
developers.

For equality operators, there is some divergence but still a very strong trend:

-   C-family languages, Rust, Swift, Kotlin, Zig, Nim, Ruby, etc. use `==` for
    equality comparison and `!=` for inequality comparison.
-   Some languages, such as ALGOL, APL, BASIC, and PL/I, use `=` as equality
    comparison, with some using a different symbol (such as `:=` or `<-`) for
    assignment and others distinguishing assignment from equality comparison
    based on context.
-   Haskell and Fortran use `==` for "equal to" and `/=` for "not equal to". The
    latter is intended to resemble a ≠ symbol.
-   Some languages, such as Pascal and BASIC, use `<>` for inequality
    comparison. Python 2 permits this as a synonym for `!=`.
-   Perl uses `eq` and `ne` for string comparisons; some shells and UNIX `test`
    use `-eq` and `-ne` for for integer comparisons.

Some languages support multiple different kinds of equality comparison, such as
both a value comparison (typically `==`) and an object identity comparison
(typically `===` or `is`). Some languages that freely convert between numbers
and strings have different operators to perform a string comparison versus a
numeric comparison. Fortran has custom `.eqv.` and `.neqv.` for equality
comparisons of Boolean values.

Some languages have synonyms for equality operators. For example, Fortran allows
`.eq.`, `.ne.`, `.gt.`, and so on, as synonyms for `==`, `/=`, `>`, and so on.
This appears to be historical: FORTRAN 77 had only the dotted forms of these
operators.

### Three-way comparisons

C++ has three-way comparisons, written using the `<=>` operator. These provide a
useful mechanism to allow overloading the behavior of relational comparisons
without defining four separate operator overloads for relational comparisons.

Similarly, Python provides a `__cmp__` special method that can be used to
implement all equality and relational comparisons.

### Chained comparisons

Python permits comparisons to be chained: that is, `a < b <= c` is interpreted
as `a < b and b <= c`, except that `b` is evaluated only once. In most C-family
languages, that expression is instead interpreted as `(a < b) <= c`, which
computes the value of `a < b`, maps `false` to `0` and `true` to `1`, then
compares the result to `c`.

## Proposal

Carbon will provide the following operators:

-   Equality comparison operators: `==` and `!=`.
-   Relational comparison operators: `<`, `<=`, `>`, `>=`.

Each has the obvious mathematical meaning, where `==` means =, `!=` means ≠,
`<=` means ≤, and `>=` means ≥.

There will be no three-way comparison operator symbol. The interface used to
support overloading comparison operators will provide a named function to
perform three-way comparisons.

Chained comparisons are an error: a comparison expression cannot appear as an
unparenthesized operand of another comparison operator.

For built-in types, we will follow these rules:

-   A comparison produces either a mathematically correct answer or a
    compilation error.
-   Do not perform implicit conversions that lose information.
-   Never invent an intermediate type that is larger than both operand types.

One indirect consequence of the second and third rule is that we never convert
both operands in a comparison.

## Details

All six operators are infix binary operators. For standard Carbon types, they
produce a `Bool` value.

### Precedence

The comparison operators are all at the same precedence level. This level is
lower than operators used to compute (non-Boolean) values, higher than the
logical operators `and` and `or`, and incomparable with the precedence of `not`.

For example, this is OK:

```
if (n + m * 3 < n * n and 3 < m and m < 6) {}
```

... but these are errors:

```
// Error, ambiguous: `(not a) == b` or `not (a == b)`?
if (not a == b) {}
// Error, requires parentheses: `a == (not b)`.
if (a == not b) {}
// Error, requires parentheses: `not (f < 5.0)`.
if (not f < 5.0) {}
```

### Associativity

The comparison operators are non-associative. For example:

```
// Error, need `3 < m and m < 6`.
if (3 < m < 6) {}
// Error, need `a == b and b == c`.
if (a == b == c) {}
// Error, need `(m > 1) == (n > 1)`.
if (m > 1 == n > 1) {}
```

### Built-in comparisons and implicit conversions

When both operands are of standard Carbon integer types (`Int(n)` or
`Unsigned(n)`), the narrower operand is converted to the width of the wider
operand, then a mathematically-correct comparison is performed.

When both operands are of standard Carbon floating-point types (`Float(n)`), the
narrower operand is converted to the width of the wider operand, then a
`Float(n)` comparison is performed.

When one operand is of floating-point type and the other is of integer type, if
all values of the integer type can be exactly represented in the floating-point
type, it is converted to the floating-point type. Otherwise, the integer operand
is required to be a constant and is required to be exactly representable in the
floating-point type. Otherwise the comparison is rejected.

For example:

```
// The value of `v` is True, because `a` is less than `b`, even though the
// result of either an `i32` comparison or a `u32` comparison would be False.
fn f(a: i32, b: u32) -> Bool { return a < b; }
let v: Bool = f(-1, 4_000_000_000);

// This does not compile, because `i64` values in general (and 10^18 in
// particular) are not exactly representable in the type `f32`.
let f: f32 = 1.0e18;
let n: i64 = 1_000_000_000_000_000_000;
let w: Bool = f == n;
```

More generally, we support the following implicit conversions:

-   from `Int(n)` to `Int(m)` if `m > n`,
-   from `Unsigned(n)` to `Int(m)` or `Unsigned(m)` if `m > n`,
-   from `Float(n)` to `Float(m)` if `m > n`, and
-   from `Int(n)` to `Float(m)` if `Float(m)` can represent all values of
    `Int(n)` or if the integer operand is a constant that is exactly
    representable in the floating-point type.

This proposal does not take an explicit stance on what it means for the integer
operand to be a constant, except that integer literals are expected to qualify
(so `f >= 0` for a floating-point value `f` is valid). For the time being, no
expression forms other than integer literals should be permitted to implicitly
convert from integer to floating-point type, although we expect this to be
revised by future proposals.

Other than the rule for converting a constant integer to floating-point, these
rules can be summarized as: a type `T` can be converted to `U` if every value of
type `T` is a value of type `U`.

We support comparison operations (both equality and relational) on the following
operand types, for each suitable value `n`:

-   `Int(n)` vs `Int(n)`
-   `Unsigned(n)` vs `Unsigned(n)`
-   `Int(n)` vs `Unsigned(n)`
-   `Unsigned(n)` vs `Int(n)`
-   `Float(n)` vs `Float(n)`

When searching for a suitable comparison, we only consider performing
conversions on one of the two operands, never both. We expect for this to also
apply to [overloaded](#overloading) comparison operators for user-defined types,
but this proposal does not constrain that decision.

The two kinds of mixed-type comparison may be [less efficient](#performance)
than the other kinds due to the slightly wider domain.

Note that this approach diverges from C++, which would convert both operands to
a common type first, sometimes performing a lossy conversion potentially giving
an incorrect result, sometimes converting both operands, and sometimes using a
wider type than either of the operand types.

#### Performance

The choice to give correct results for signed/unsigned comparisons has a
performance impact in practice, because it exposes operations that some
processors do not currently directly support.
[Sample microbenchmarks](https://godbolt.org/z/dfGe4MhEx) for implementations of
several operations show the following performance on x86_64 (use the Quick-bench
link in Compiler Explorer to run the benchmarks):

| Operation   | Mathematical comparison time | C++ comparison time | Ratio |
| ----------- | ---------------------------- | ------------------- | ----- |
| `i64 < u64` | 2814                         | 992                 | 2.8x  |
| `u64 < i64` | 1957                         | 1012                | 1.9x  |

The mixed-type operations are typically 2-3x slower than the same-type
operations. However, this is a predictable performance change, and can be
controlled by the developer by converting the operands to a suitable type prior
to the conversion if a faster same-type comparison is preferred over a correct
mixed-type comparison.

It is likely that better code could be generated than that currently produced in
this benchmark for these operations.

### Overloading

Separate interfaces will be provided to permit overloading equality and
relational comparisons. The exact design of those interfaces is left to a future
proposal. As non-binding design guidance for such a proposal:

-   The interface for equality comparisons should primarily provide the ability
    to override the behavior of `==`. The `!=` operator can optionally also be
    overridden, with a default implementation that returns `not (a == b)`.
-   The interface for relational comparisons should primarily provide the
    ability to specify a three-way comparison operator. The individual
    relational comparison operators can optionally be overridden separately,
    with a default implementation in terms of the three-way comparison operator.
-   Overloaded comparison operators may wish to produce a type other than
    `Bool`, for uses such as a vector comparison producing a vector of `Bool`
    values.

### Default implementations for basic types

In addition to being defined for standard Carbon numeric types, equality and
relational comparisons are also defined for all "data" types:

-   Tuples.
-   Structs (structural data classes).
-   Classes implementing an interface that identifies them as data classes.

Relational comparisons for these types provide a lexicographical ordering. This
proposal defers to
[#561](https://github.com/carbon-language/carbon-lang/pull/561) for details on
comparison support for classes.

In each case, the comparison is only available if it is supported by all element
types.

The `Bool` type should be treated as a choice type, and so should support
equality comparisons and relational comparisons if and only if choice types do
in general. That decision is left to a future proposal.

## Rationale based on Carbon's goals

-   _Performance-critical software:_

    -   The use of a three-way comparison as the central primitive for
        overloading relational comparisons provides predictable, composable
        performance for comparing hierarchical data structures.

-   _Code that is easy to read, understand, and write:_

    -   The chosen precedence and associativity rules aim to avoid bugs and
        ensure the code does what it appears to do, requiring parentheses in
        cases where the intent is unclear.
    -   The choice to not convert operands of a comparison operator removes a
        source of bugs caused by unintended lossy conversions.

-   _Interoperability with and migration from existing C++ code:_

    -   The use of the chosen operator symbols exactly matches C++, reducing
        friction for developers and code moving between the two languages, and
        for interoperability.

## Alternatives considered

### Alternative symbols

We could use `/=` instead of `!=` for not-equal comparisons.

Advantages:

-   Avoids overloading `!` for both "not equals" and template/generic use in
    `:!` bindings.
-   There is no other usage of `!` meaning "not" in the language because we use
    a `not` operator.

Disadvantages:

-   Unfamiliar to C++ programmers.
-   `a /= b` would likely be expected to mean an `a = a / b` compound
    assignment.
-   Breaks consistency with Python, which uses `not` for logical negation and
    `!=` for inequality comparison.

We could use `=/=` instead of `!=` for not-equal comparisons.

Advantages:

-   As above; also `=/=` looks like an `==` with a line through the middle.

Disadvantages:

-   This would be inventive and unlike all other languages. As above, breaks
    consistency with Python.
-   This would make `=/=` one character longer, and harder to type on US-ASCII
    keyboards because the keys are distant but likely to be typed with the same
    finger.

### Chained comparisons

We could support Python-like chained comparisons.

Advantages:

-   Small ergonomic improvement for range comparisons.
-   Middle operand is evaluated only once.

Disadvantages:

-   Using the middle expression as an argument to two different functions may
    create problems, as the value will need to be stored somewhere, potentially
    changing the semantics of the operator expression as we can no longer move
    from the operand.
-   Both short-circuiting behavior and non-short-circuiting behavior will be
    surprising and unintuitive to some. The short-circiuting option will
    introduce control flow without a keyword to announce it, which goes against
    our design decision to use a keyword for `and` and `or` to announce the
    control flow. The non-short-circuiting option will evaluate subexpressions
    unnecessarily, which creates a tension with our performance goal.
-   Experienced C++ developers may expect a different behavior, such as
    `a < b == cmp` comparing the result of `a < b` against the Boolean value
    `cmp`.

See also the ongoing discussion in
[#451](https://github.com/carbon-language/carbon-lang/issues/451).

### Convert operands like C++

We could convert the operands of comparison operators in a way that's equivalent
to C++'s behavior.

Advantages:

-   May ease migration from C++.
-   May allow programmers to reuse some intuition, for example when comparing
    floating-point values against integer values.
-   Allows more efficient machine code to be generated for source code that
    takes no special care about the types of comparison operands.
-   Improves performance predictability for C++ developers unfamiliar with
    Carbon's rules.

Disadvantages:

-   Produces incorrect results.
-   Does not provide a simple syntax for correct mixed-type comparisons.

### Provide a three-way comparison operator

We could provide a symbol for three-way comparisons, such as C++20's `<=>`.

Advantages:

-   The use of a symbol rather than a named member of an interface for this
    functionality may ease migration from C++20.

Disadvantages:

-   Reserves a symbol for an operation that should not be used directly except
    in special circumstances, and that will produce a nuanced type even when
    comparing standard Carbon types such as `f32`.

### Allow comparisons as the operand of `not`

We could permit comparisons to appear as the immediate operand of `not` without
parentheses.

Advantages:

-   Provides an easier syntax for floating-point comparisons where the desired
    result for a NaN operand is `True` rather than `False`: `not f < 5.0`.

Disadvantages:

-   Introduces ambiguity when comparing Boolean values: `not cond1 == cond2`
    might intend to compare `not cond1` to `cond2` rather than comparing
    `cond1 != cond2`.
