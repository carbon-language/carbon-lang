## Problem

We need to be able to compare values for equality, and to compare ordered values
for relative ordering.

## Background

### Terminology

We refer to tests that check whether two values are the same or different as
_equality_ comparisons, and to tests that determine the relative ordering of two
values as _relational_ comparisons.

### Usage in existing languages

There is near-universal convention on the use of the following symbols for
relational operators:

-   `<`, `<=`, `>`, and `>=` perform ordered comparisons (less than, less than
    or equal to, greater than, greater than or equal to).

There are rare exceptions in somewhat esoteric languages: some languages use `≤`
and `≥`, but these are not straightforward to type for many potential Carbon
developers.

For equality operators, there is some divergence but still a very strong trend:

-   C-family languages, Rust, Swift, Kotlin, Zig, Nim, Ruby, etc. use `==` for
    equality comparison and `!=` for inequality comparison.
-   Some languages, such as ALGOL, APL, BASIC, and PL/I, use `=` as equality
    comparison, with some using a different symbol (such as `:=` or `<-`) for
    assignment and others distinguishing assignment from equality comparison
    based on context.
-   Haskell and Fortran use `==` for "equal to" and `/=` for "not equal to". The
    latter is intended to resemble a ≠ symbol.
-   Some languages, such as Pascal and BASIC, use `<>` for inequality
    comparison. Python 2 permits this as a synonym for `!=`.
-   Perl uses `eq` and `ne` for string comparisons; some shells and UNIX `test`
    use `-eq` and `-ne` for for integer comparisons.

Some languages support multiple different kinds of equality comparison, such as
both a value comparison (typically `==`) and an object identity comparison
(typically `===` or `is`). Some languages that freely convert between numbers
and strings have different operators to perform a string comparison versus a
numeric comparison. Fortran has custom `.eqv.` and `.neqv.` for equality
comparisons of Boolean values.

Some languages have synonyms for equality operators. For example, Fortran allows
`.eq.`, `.ne.`, `.gt.`, and so on, as synonyms for `==`, `/=`, `>`, and so on.
This appears to be historical: FORTRAN 77 had only the dotted forms of these
operators.

### Three-way comparisons

C++ has three-way comparisons, written using the `<=>` operator. These provide a
useful mechanism to allow overloading the behavior of relational comparisons
without defining four separate operator overloads for relational comparisons.

Similarly, Python provides a `__cmp__` special method that can be used to
implement all equality and relational comparisons.

### Chained comparisons

Python permits comparisons to be chained: that is, `a < b <= c` is interpreted
as `a < b and b <= c`, except that `b` is evaluated only once. In most C-family
languages, that expression is instead interpreted as `(a < b) <= c`, which
computes the value of `a < b`, maps `false` to `0` and `true` to `1`, then
compares the result to `c`.

## Proposal

Carbon will provide the following operators:

-   Equality comparison operators: `==` and `!=`.
-   Relational comparison operators: `<`, `<=`, `>`, `>=`.

Each has the obvious mathematical meaning, where `==` means =, `!=` means ≠,
`<=` means ≤, and `>=` means ≥.

There will be no three-way comparison operator symbol. The interface used to
support overloading comparison operators will provide a named function to
perform three-way comparisons.

Chained comparisons are an error: a comparison expression cannot appear as an
unparenthesized operand of another comparison operator.

## Details

All six operators are infix binary operators. For standard Carbon types, they
produce a `Bool` value.

### Precedence

The comparison operators are all at the same precedence level. This level is
lower than operators used to compute (non-Boolean) values, higher than the
logical operators `and` and `or`, and incomparable with the precedence of `not`.

For example, this is OK:

```
if (n + m * 3 < n * n and 3 < m and m < 6) {
```

... but these are errors:

```
if (not a == b) { // error, ambiguous: `(not a) == b` or `not (a == b)`?
if (a == not b) { // error, requires parentheses: `a == (not b)`
if (not f < 5.0) { // error, requires parentheses: `not (f < 5.0)`
```

### Associativity

The comparison operators are non-associative. For example:

```
if (3 < m < 6) { // error, need `3 < m and m < 6`
if (a == b == c) { // error, need `a == b and b == c`
if (m > 1 == n > 1) { // error, need `(m > 1) == (n > 1)`
```

### Conversions

When both operands are of standard Carbon numeric types (`Int(n)` or
`Float(n)`), no conversions are performed on either operand, and the result is
the mathematically correct result for that comparison, or `False` if either
operand is a NaN. For example:

```
// The value of `v` is True, because `a` is less than `b`, even though the
// result of either an `i32` comparison or a `u32` comparison would be False.
fn f(a: i32, b: u32) -> Bool { return a < b; }
let v: Bool = f(-1, 4_000_000_000);

// The value of `w` is False, because `f` has value 999999984306749440, which
// is not exactly equal to n.
let f: f32 = 1.0e18;
let n: i64 = 1_000_000_000_000_000_000;
let w: Bool = f == n;
```

An equivalent viewpoint is that the comparison is performed in a hypothetical
suffiicently large type. For example, a comparison of `i32` against `u32` can be
performed in `i64`, and a comparison of `f32` against `i32` can be performed in
`f64`. However, no such type is required to actually exist.

Note that this diverges from C++, which would convert both operands to a common
type first, sometimes performing a lossy conversion.

### Overloading

Separate interfaces will be provided to permit overloading equality and
relational comparisons. The exact design of those interfaces is left to a future
proposal. As non-binding design guidance for such a proposal:

-   The interface for equality comparisons should primarily provide the ability
    to override the behavior of `==`. The
    !=`operator can optionally also be overridden, with a default implementation that returns`not
    (a == b)`.
-   The interface for relational comparisons should primarily provide the
    ability to specify a three-way comparison operator. The individual
    relational comparison operators can optionally be overridden separately,
    with a default implementation in terms of the three-way comparison operator.
-   Overloaded comparison operators may wish to produce a type other than
    `Bool`, for uses such as a vector comparison producing a vector of `Bool`
    values.

### Default implementations for basic types

In addition to being defined for standard Carbon numeric types, equality
comparisons are also defined for all "data" types:

-   Tuples.
-   Structs (structural data classes).
-   Classes implementing an interface that identifies them as data classes.

In addition, relational comparisons are defined for tuples, and provide a
lexicographical ordering.

In each case, the ordering is only available if it is supported by all element
types.

The `Bool` type supports equality comparisons and relational comparisons. For
relational comparisons, `False` is treated as being less than `True`.

## Rationale based on Carbon's goals

-   _Performance-critical software:_

    -   The use of a three-way comparison as the central primitive for
        overloading relational comparisons provides predictable, composable
        performance for comparing hierarchical data structures.

-   _Code that is easy to read, understand, and write:_

    -   The chosen precedence and associativity rules aim to avoid bugs and
        ensure the code does what it appears to do, requiring parentheses in
        cases where the intent is unclear.
    -   The choice to not convert operands of a comparison operator removes a
        source of bugs caused by unintended lossy conversions.

-   _Interoperability with and migration from existing C++ code:_

    -   The use of the chosen operator symbols exactly matches C++, reducing
        friction for developers and code moving between the two languages, and
        for interoperability.

## Alternatives considered

### Alternative symbols

We could use `/=` instead of `!=` for not-equal comparisons.

Advantages:

-   Avoids overloading `!` for both "not equals" and template/generic use in
    `:!` bindings.
-   There is no other usage of `!` meaning "not" in the language because we use
    a `not` operator.

Disadvantages:

-   Unfamiliar to C++ programmers.
-   `a /= b` would likely be expected to mean an `a = a / b` compound
    assignment.

We could use `=/=` instead of `!=` for not-equal comparisons.

Advantages:

-   As above; also `=/=` looks like an `==` with a line through the middle.

Disadvantages:

-   This would be inventive and unlike all other languages.
-   This would make `=/=` one character longer, and harder to type on US-ASCII
    keyboards because the keys are distant but likely to be typed with the same
    finger.

### Chained comparisons

We could support Python-like chained comparisons.

Advantages:

-   Small ergonomic improvement for range comparisons.

Disadvantages:

-   Using the middle expression as an argument to two different functions may
    create problems, as the value will need to be stored somewhere, potentially
    changing the semantics of the operator expression as we can no longer move
    from the operand.
-   Both short-circuiting behavior and non-short-circuiting behavior will be
    surprising and unintuitive to some.

### Convert operands like C++

We could convert the operands of comparison operators in a way that's equivalent
to C++'s behavior.

Advantages:

-   May ease migration from C++.
-   May allow programmers to reuse some intuition, for example when comparing
    floating-point values against integer values.
-   May allow more efficient machine code to be generated for source code that
    takes no special care about the types of comparison operands.

Disadvantages:

-   Produces incorrect results.
-   Does not provide a simple syntax for correct mixed-type comparisons.

### Provide a three-way comparison operator

We could provide a symbol for three-way comparisons, such as C++20's `<=>`.

Advantages:

-   The use of a symbol rather than a named member of an interface for this
    functionality may ease migration from C++20.

Disadvantages:

-   Reserves a symbol for an operation that should not be used directly except
    in special circumstances, and that will produce a nuanced type even when
    comparing standard Carbon types such as `f32`.

### Allow comparisons as the operand of `not`

We could permit comparisons to appear as the immediate operand of `not` without
parentheses.

Advantages:

-   Provides an easier syntax for floating-point comparisons where the desired
    result for a NaN operand is `True` rather than `False`: `not f < 5.0`.

Disadvantages:

-   Introduces ambiguity when comparing Boolean values: `not cond1 == cond2`
    might intend to compare `not cond1` to `cond2` rather than cmoparing
    `cond1 != cond2`.

### Disallow relational comparisons of Boolean values

We could disallow ordered comparisons of Boolean values.

Advantages:

-   Disallows an operation that might be unintended.

Disadvantages:

-   Disallows an operation that might be intended.
-   Likely to make `Bool` behave differently from discriminated union types,
    which are likely to be treated as data types.
