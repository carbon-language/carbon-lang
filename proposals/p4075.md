## Abstract

Update the operator precedence to achieve a few goals:

-   Form operators into groups which behave similarly
-   Make the group of operators ("top-level operators") that capture everything
    to the right, like `if`...`then`...`else`, behave similarly to the left, so
    that rearranging expressions won't change how they group.
-   Add the `where` operator, used to specify constraints on facet types, to the
    precedence chart, to define how it interacts with other operators.
-   Make the operator precedence diagram prettier, so that it eventually can be
    made into a poster that Carbon programmers can hang on their walls.

## Problem

The `where` operator is particularly tricky:

-   It is used in an `impl` declaration to specify the values of associated
    constants (such as associated types). In that context, `impl T as I where R`
    is interpreted conceptually as `impl T as (I where R)`. It would be nice if
    `T as I where R` would mean the same thing in other contexts.
-   The `where` operator will frequently be used with the binary `&` operator,
    since that is how facet types are combined. It is desirable that
    `I & J where R` be interpreted as `(I & J) where R`. This is expected to be
    more common than combinging `where` and `as` outside of an `impl`
    declaration.
-   The "restriction" on the right side of a `where` uses operators that mean
    something else in an expression context: `and`, `==`, `=`. We would like to
    minimize the confusion when both kinds of uses of those operators appear in
    the same expression.

These goals are in conflict with the current precedence partial order.

## Background

The initial operator precedence approach, including using a partial precedence
ordering instead of a total ordering as found in most languages, was established
by [propsoal #555](https://github.com/carbon-language/carbon-lang/pull/555).
[PR #1070](https://github.com/carbon-language/carbon-lang/pull/1070) established
the current precedence chart, which has been incrementally added to since then.

## Proposal

TODO: Briefly and at a high level, how do you propose to solve the problem? Why
will that in fact solve it?

## Details

TODO: Fully explain the details of the proposed solution.

## Rationale

TODO: How does this proposal effectively advance Carbon's goals? Rather than
re-stating the full motivation, this should connect that motivation back to
Carbon's stated goals and principles. This may evolve during review. Use links
to appropriate sections of [`/docs/project/goals.md`](/docs/project/goals.md),
and/or to documents in [`/docs/project/principles`](/docs/project/principles).
