## Problem

We need to say how you define new types in Carbon. This proposal is specifically
about [record types](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Record_(computer_science)>).
The proposal is not intended to be a complete story for record types, but enough
to get agreement on direction. It primarily focuses on:

-   use cases including: data types, non-virtual object types, abstract base
    classes that support multiple inheritance, single-inheritance polymorphic
    types, and mixins for code reuse;
-   anonymous data types for struct literals used to initialize struct values
    and ad-hoc parameter and return types with named components; and
-   future work, including the provisional syntax in use for features that have
    not been decided.

## Background

This is a replacement for earlier proposal
[#98](https://github.com/carbon-language/carbon-lang/pull/98).

## Proposal

This proposal adds an initial design for record types called "structs",
including anonymous structs and anonymous struct literals. The design is
replacing the skeletal design present in
[this document](/docs/design/structs.md).

## Rationale based on Carbon's goals

This particular proposal is focusing on
[the Carbon goal](/docs/project/goals.md#code-that-is-easy-to-read-understand-and-write)
that code is "easy to read, understand, and write." Future proposals will
address other aspects of the `struct` design such as performance.

## Alternatives considered

See earlier proposal
[#98](https://github.com/carbon-language/carbon-lang/pull/98).
