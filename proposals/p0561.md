## Problem

We need to say how you define new types in Carbon. This proposal is specifically
about [record types](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Record_(computer_science)>).

## Background

This is a replacement for earlier proposal #98.

## Proposal

This proposal adds an initial design for record types called "structs",
including anonymous structs and anonymous struct literals. The design is
replacing the skeletal design present in
[this document](/docs/design/structs.md).

## Rationale based on Carbon's goals

This particular proposal is focusing on
[the Carbon goal](/docs/project/goals.md#code-that-is-easy-to-read-understand-and-write)
that code is "easy to read, understand, and write." Future proposals will
address other aspects of the `struct` design such as performance.

## Alternatives considered

See earlier proposal #98.
