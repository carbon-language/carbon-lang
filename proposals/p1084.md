## Problem

Developers want to organize their code for readability and convenience. For
example, they may want to present the public API of their type in a concise way.
That includes the ability to say a type implements an interface without
repeating the full contents of that interface.

The Carbon compiler can give better diagnostics if it can assume every
identifier it encounters refers to something earlier declaration in the file.
However, sometimes multiple entities will reference each other in a cycle so no
one entity can be defined first.

## Background

We have decided to tackle these problems in a manner similar to C++ by
supporting forward declarations:

-   [issue #472: Open question: Calling functions defined later in the same file](https://github.com/carbon-language/carbon-lang/issues/472)
-   [proposal #875: Principle: information accumulation](https://github.com/carbon-language/carbon-lang/pull/875).

Use of the `default` keyword in `interface` definitions to allow defaulted
members to be defined out-of-line was originally proposed in
[withdrawn proposal #1034](https://github.com/carbon-language/carbon-lang/pull/1034).

## Proposal

This proposal makes changes to these sections of the
[generics details design document](/docs/design/generics/details.md):

-   [Forward declarations and cyclic references](/docs/design/generics/details.md#forward-declarations-and-cyclic-references)
    section added
-   [Interface members with definitions](/docs/design/generics/details.md#interface-members-with-definitions)
    section added to

## Rationale based on Carbon's goals

Forward declarations are intended to advance these goals:

-   [Language tools and ecosystem](/docs/project/goals.md#language-tools-and-ecosystem),
    by making Carbon easier to interpret by code in a single top-down pass.
-   [Code that is easy to read, understand, and write](/docs/project/goals.md#code-that-is-easy-to-read-understand-and-write),
    by allowing developers to separate declaration from definition when
    organizing the presentation of their code, and imposing constraints that
    allow readers to interpret the code with less skipping around.

## Alternatives considered

TODO: What alternative solutions have you considered?

FIXME: Forbid forward declarations of impls for incomplete types

FIXME: Allow external impl declarations to be redeclared as internal

FIXME: No `default` keyword, so default definitions would always have to be
inline, see discussion in
[the #syntax channel on Discord](https://discord.com/channels/655572317891461132/709488742942900284/941408009689641010)
and
[question-for-leads issue #1082: Use `default` keyword in interface defaults?](https://github.com/carbon-language/carbon-lang/issues/1082)

FIXME: For simplicity, generally Carbon entities should either be "incomplete"
or "defined" and never "partially defined". We make an exception for interface
implementations, due to their role as the
[one static open extension mechanism](https://github.com/carbon-language/carbon-lang/pull/998).
