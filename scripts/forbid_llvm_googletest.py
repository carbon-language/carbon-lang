"""Detects and prevents dependencies on LLVM's googletest.

Carbon uses googletest directly, and it's a significantly more recent version
than is provided by LLVM. Using both versions in the same binary leads to
problems, so this detects dependencies.

We also have some dependency checking at //bazel/check_deps. This is a separate
script because check_deps relies on being able to validate specific binaries
which change infrequently, whereas this effectively monitors all cc_test rules,
the set of which is expected to be altered more often.
